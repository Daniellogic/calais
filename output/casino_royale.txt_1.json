Then the soul- \nerosion produced by high gambling— a compost of \ngreed and fear and nervous tension — becomes unbear- \nable, and the senses awake and revolt from it. \n\nJames Bond suddenly knew that he was tired. He \nalways knew when his body or his mind had had \nenough, and he always acted on the knowledge. This \nhelped him to avoid staleness and the sensual bluntness \nthat breeds mistakes. \n\nHe shifted himself unobtrusively away from the \nroulette he had been playing and went to stand for a \nmoment at the brass rail which surrounded breast-high \nthe top table in the salle privee. \n\nLe Chiffre was : still playing and still, apparently, \nwinning. There was an untidy pile of flecked hundred- \nmille plaques in front of him. In the shadow of his thick \nleft arm there nestled a discreet stack of the big yellow \nones worth half a million francs each. \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nBond -watched the curious, impressive profile for a \ntime, and then he shrugged his shoulders to lighten his \nthoughts and moved away. \n\nThe barrier surrounding the caisse comes as high as \nyour chin, and the caissier, who is generally nothing \nmore than a minor bank clerk, sits on a stool and dips \ninto his piles of notes and plaques. These are ranged on \nshelves. They are on a level, behind the protecting \nbarrier* with your groin. The caissier has a cosh and a \ngun to protect him, and to heave over the barrier and \nsteal some notes and then vault back and get out of the \nCasino through the passages and doors would be im- \npossible. And the caissiers generally work in pairs. \n\nBond reflected on the problem as he collected the \nsheaf of hundred-thousand and then the sheaves of ten- \nthousand-franc notes. With another part of his mind, he \nhad a vision of tomorrow's regular morning meeting of \nthe Casino committee. \n\n'Monsieur Le Chiffre made two million. He played \nhis usual game. Miss Fairchild made a million an hour \nand then left. She executed\\hree bancos of Monsieur Le \nChiffre within an hour and then left. She played with \ncoolness. Monsieur le Vicomte de Villorin made one \nmillion two at roulette. He was playing the maximum on \nthe first and last dozens. He was lucky. Then the \nEnglishman, Mister Bond, increased his winnings to \nexactly three million over the two days. He was playing \na progressive system on red at table five. Duclos, the \nchef de partie, has the details. It seems that he is per- \nsevering and pays in maximums. He has luck. His \nnerves seem good. On the soiree, the chemin-de-fer won \nx, the baccarat won.y and the roulette won z. The boule, \nwhich was again badly frequented, still makes its ex- \npenses.' \n\n'Merci, Monsieur Xavier. ' \n\n'Merci, Monsieur le President.' \n\nOr something like that, thought Bond as he pushed \n\n\n\nTHE SECRET AGENT \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\nhis way through the swing doors of the salle privee and \nnodded to the bored man in evening clothes whose job it \nis to bar your entry and your exit and the electric foot- \nswitch which can lock the door at any hint of trouble. \n\nAnd the Casino committee 'would balance its books \nand break up to its homes or cafSs for lunch. \n\nAs for robbing the caisse, in which Bond himself was \nnot personally concerned, but only interested, he- re- \nflected that it would take ten good men, that they would \ncertainly have to kill one or two employees, and that \nanyway you probably couldn't find ten non-squeal \nkillers in France, or in any other country for the matter \nof that. \n\nAs he gave a thousand francs to the 'vestiaire' and \nwalked down the steps of the Casino, Bond made up his \nmind that Le Chiffre would in no circumstances try to \nrob the caisse; and he put the contingency out of his \nmind. Instead he explored his present physical sen- \nsations. He felt the dry, uncomfortable gravel under his \nevening shoes, the bad ( harsh taste in his mouth, and the \nslight sweat under his arms. He could feel his eyes filling \ntheir sockets. The front of his face, his nose and an- \ntrum, were congested. He breathed the sweet night air \ndeeply and focused his senses and his wits. He wanted to \nknow if anyone had searched his room since he had left \nit before dinner. \n\n. He walked across the broad boulevard and through \nthe gardens to the Hotel Splendide. He smiled at the \nconcierge who gave him his key— No. 45 on the first \nfloor — and took the cable. \nIt was from Jamaica and read: \n\n\n\nKINGSTON J A XXXX XXXXXX XXXX XXX \nBOND SPLENDIDE ROYALE-LES-EAUX SEINE IN- \nFERIEURE HAVANA- CIGAR PRODUCTION ALL \nCUBAN FACTORIES 1915 TEN MILLION REPEAT TEN \n\n\n\n4 CASINO ROYALE \n\nMILLION STOP HOPE THIS FIGURE YOU REQUIRE \nREGARDS \n\nDASILVA \n\n\n\nThis meant that ten million francs was on the way to \nhim. It was the reply to a request Bond had sent that af- \nternoon through Paris to his headquarters in London \nasking for more funds. Paris had spoken to London \nwhere Clements, the head of Bond's department, had \nspoken to M. who had smiled wryly and told 'The \nBroker' to fix it with the Treasury. \n\nBond had once worked in Jamaica, and his cover on \nthe Royale assignment was that of a very rich client of \nMessrs. Caffery, the principal import and export firm \nof Jamaica. So he was being controlled through \nJamaica, through a taciturn man who was head of the \npicture desk on the Daily Gleaner, the famous \nnewspaper of the Caribbean. \n\nThis man on the Gleaner, whose name was.Fawcett, \nhad been bookkeeper for one of the leading turtle- \nfisheries on the Cayman Islands. One of the men from \nthe Caymans who had volunteered on the outbreak of \nwar, he had ended up as a Paymaster's clerk in a small \nnaval intelligence organization in Malta. At the end of \nthe war, when, with a heavy heart, he was about to \nreturn to the Caymans, he was spotted by the section of \nthe Secret Service concerned with the Caribbean. He \nwas strenuously trained in photography and in some \nother arts and, with the quiet connivance of an in- \nfluential man in Jamaica, found his way to the picture \ndesk of the Gleaner. \n\nIn the intervals between sifting photographs sub- \nmitted by the great agencies— Keystone, Wide World, \nUniversal, I.N.P., and Reuter-Photo — he would get \nperemptory instructions by telephone from a man he \nhad never met to carry out certain simple operations \nrequiring nothing but absolute discretion, speed, and \n\n\n\nTHE SECRET AGENT \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\naccuracy. For these occasional services he received \ntwenty pounds a month paid into his account with the \nRoyal Bank of Canada by a fictitious relative in \nEngland. \n\nFawcett's present assignment was to relay im- \nmediately to Bond, full rates, the text of messages which \nhe received at home by telephone from his anonymous \ncontact. He had been told by this contact that nothing \nhe would be asked to send would arouse the suspicion of \nthe Jamaican post office. So he was not surprised to \nfind himself suddenly appointed string correspondent \nfor the 'Maritime Press and Photo Agency,' with press- \ncollect facilities to France and England, on a further \nmonthly retainer of ten pounds. \n\nHe felt secure and, encouraged, had visions of a \nB.E.M. and made the first payment on a Morris Minor. \nHe also bought a green eyeshade which he had long \ncoveted, and which helped him to impose his personality \non the picture desk. , \n\nSome of this background to his cable passed through \nBond's mind. He was used to oblique control and rather \nliked it. He felt it featherbedded him a little, allowed \nhim to give or take an hour or. two in his com- \nmunications with M. He knew that this was probably a \nfallacy, that probably there was another member of the \nService at Royale-les-Eaux who was reporting in- \ndependently, but it did give the illusion that he wasn't \nonly 150 miles across the Channel from that deadly of- \nfice building near Regent's Park, being watched and \njudged by those few cold brains that made the whole \nshow work. Just as Fawcett, the Cayman Islander in \nKingston, knew that if he bought that Morris Minor \noutright instead of signing the hire-purchase agreement, \nsomeone in London would probably know and want to \nknow where the money had come from. \n\nBond read the cable twice. He tore a telegraph form \noff the; pad on the desk (why give them carbon copies?) \nand wrote his reply in capital letters: \n\n\n\n6 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nTHANKS INFORMATION SHOULD SUFFICE \n\nBOND. \n\nHe handed this to the concierge and put the cable \nsigned 'Dasilva' in his pocket. The employers (if any) of \nthe concierge could bribe a copy out of the local post of- \nfice, if the concierge hadn't already steamed the en- \nvelope open or read the cable upside down in Bond's \nhands. \n\nHe took his key and said good night and turned to the \nstairs, shaking his head at the liftman. Bond knew what \nan obliging danger-signal a lift could be. He didn't ex- \npect anyone to be moving on the first floor, but he \npreferred to be prudent. \n\nWalking quietly up on the balls of his feet, he re- \ngretted the hubris of his reply to M. via Jamaica. As a \ngambler he knew it was a mistake to rely on too small a \ncapital. Anyway, M. probably wouldn't let him have \nany more. He shrugged his shoulders and turned off the \nstairs into the corridor and walked softly to the door of \nhis room. \n\nBond knew exactly where the switch was, and it was \nwith one flow of motion that he stood on the threshold \nwith the door full open, the light on and a gun in his \nhand. The safe, empty room sneered at him. He ignored \nthe half-open door of the bathroom and, after locking \nhimself in, he turned up the bed-light and the mirror- \nlight and threw his gun on the settee beside the window. \nThen he bent down and inspected one of his own black \nhairs which still lay undisturbed where he had left it \nbefore dinner, wedged into the drawer of the writing- \ndesk. \n\nNext he examined a faint trace of talcum powder on \nthe inner rim of the porcelain handle of the clothes cup- \nboard. It appeared immaculate. He went into the \nbathroom, lifted the cover of the lavatory cistern and \n\n\n\nTHE SECRET AGENT \n\n\n\n7 \n\n\n\nverified the level of the water against a small scratch on \nthe copper ball-cock. \n\nDoing alL this, inspecting these minute burglar- \nalarms, did not make him feel foolish or self-conscious. \nHe was a secret agent, and still alive thanks to his exact \nattention to the detail of his profession. Routine \nprecautions were to him no more unreasonable than \nthey would be to a deep-sea diver or a test pilot, or to \nany man earning danger-money. \n\nSatisfied that his room had not been searched while \nhe was at the Casino, Bond undressed and took a cold \nshower. Then he lit his seventieth cigarette of the day \nand sat down at the writing-table with the thick wad of \nhis stake money and winnings beside him and entered \nsome figures in a small notebook. Over the two days' \nplay, he was up exactly three million francs. In London \nhe had been issued with ten million, and he had asked \nLondon for a further ten. With this on its way to the \nlocal branch of the Credit Lyonnais, his working capital \namounted to twenty-three million francs, or some \ntwenty-three thousand pounds. \n\nFor a few moments Bond sat motionless, gazing out \nof the \"window across the dark sea; then he shoved the \nbundle of banknotes under the pillow of the ornate \nsingle bed, cleaned his teeth, turned out the lights and \nclimbed with relief between the harsh French sheets. For \nten minutes he lay on his left side reflecting on the \nevents of the day. Then he turned over and focused his \nmind towards the tunnel of sleep. \n\nHis last action was to slip his right hand under the \npillow until it rested under the butt of the .38 Colt \nPolice Positive with the sawn barrel. Then he slept, and \n. with the warmth and humour of his eyes extinguished \nhis features relapsed into a taciturn mask, ironical, \nbrutal, and cold. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2 \n\nDossier for M. \n\n\n\nTwo weeks before, this memorandum had gone \nfrom Station S. of the Secret Service to M., who was \nthen and is today head of this adjunct to the British \ndefence ministries: \n\nTo: M. \n\nFrom: Head of S. \n\nSubject: A project for the destruction of Monsieur \nLe Chiffre (alias 'The Number,' 'Herr Hum- \nmer,' 'Herr Ziffer,' etc.), one of the Opposi- \ntion's chief agents in France and undercover \nPaymaster of the 'Syndicat des Ouvriers \nd' Alsace,' the communist-controlled trade \nunion in the heavy and transport industries of \nAlsace and, as we know, an important fifth col- \numn in the event of war with Redland. \n\nDocumentation: Head of Archives' biography of \nLe Chiffre is attached at Appendix A. Also, Ap- \npendix B, a note onSMERSH. \n\n\n\n8 \n\n\n\nDOSSIER FOR M. \n\n\n\n• • • \n\nWe have been feeling for some time that Le \nChiffre is getting into deep water. In nearly all \nrespects he is an admirable agent of the U.S.S.R.j \nbut his gross physical habits and predilections are \nan Achilles heel of which we have been able to \ntake advantage from time to time, and one of his \nmistresses is a Eurasian (No. 1860) controlled by \nStation F., who has recently been able to obtain \nsome insight into his private affairs. \n\nBriefly, it seems that Le Chiffre is on the brink \nof a financial crisis. Certain straws in the wind \nwere noticed by 1860 — some discreet sales of \njewellery, the disposal of a villa at Antibes, and a \ngeneral tendency to check the loose spending \nwhich had always been a feature of his way of life. \nFurther inquiries were made with the help of our \nfriends of the Deuxieme Bureau (with whom we \nhave been working jointly on this case) and a \ncurious story has come to light. \n\nIn January 1946 Le Chiffre bought control of a \nchain of brothels, known as the 'Cordon Jaune,' \noperating in Normandy and Brittany. He was \nfoolish enough to employ for this purpose some \nfifty million francs of the moneys entrusted to him \nby Leningrad Section III for the financing of \nS.O.D.A., the trade union mentioned above. \n\nNormally the Cordon Jaune would have proved \na most excellent investment; and it is possible that \nLe Chiffre was motivated more by a desire to in- \ncrease his union funds than by the hope of lining \nhis own pocket by speculating with his employers' \nmoney. However that may be, it is clear that he \ncould have found many investments more savoury \nthan prostitution, if he had not been tempted by \nthe by-product of unlimited women for his per- \nsonal use. \n\nFate rebuked him with terrifying swiftness. \n\n\n\n10 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nBarely three months later, on the 13th April, \nthere was passed in France Law No. 46685 entitled \nLoi Tendant a la Fermeture des Maisons de \nTolerance et au Renforcement de la Lutte cohtre le \nProxenitisme. \\ \n\n(When M. came to this sentence he grunted and \npressed a switch on the intercom. \n'Head of S?' \n'Sir.' \n\n'What the hell does this word mean? ' He spelt it out. \n'Pimping, sir. 5 \n\n'This is not the Berlitz School of Languages, Head of \nS. If you want to show off your knowledge of foreign \njawbreakers, be good enough to provide a crib. Better \nstill, write in English.' \n\n'Sorry, sir.' \n\nM. released the switch and turned back to the \nmemorandum.) \\ \n\nThis law (he read), known popularly as 'La Loi \nMarthe Richard,' closing all houses of ill- fame \nand forbidding the sale of pornographic books \nand films, knocked the bottom out of his in- \nvestment almost overnight, and suddenly Le \nChiffre was faced with a serious deficit in his \nunion funds. In desperation he turned his open \nhouses into 'maisons de passe' where clandestine \nrendezvous could be arranged on the border-line \nof the law, and he continued to operate one or two \n'cinemas bleus' underground; but these shifts in \nno way served to cover his overheads, and all at- \ntempts to sell his investment, even at a heavy loss, \nfailed dismally. Meanwhile the Police des Moeurs \nwere on his trail, and in a short while twenty or \nmore of his establishments were closed down. \n\nThe police were, of course, only interested in \nthis man as a big-time brothel-keeper, and it was \n\n\n\nDOSSIER FORM. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n\n\nnot until we expressed an interest in his finances \nthat the Deuxieme Bureau unearthed the parallel \ndossier which was running with their colleagues of \nthe police department. \n\nThe significance of the situation became ap- \nparent to us and to our French friends, and, in the \npast few months, a veritable rat-hunt has been \noperated by the police after the establishments of \nthe Cordon Jaune, with the result that today \nnothing remains of Le Chiffre's original in- \nvestment, and any routine inquiry would reveal a \ndeficit of around fifty million francs in the trade- \nunion funds of which he is the treasurer and \npaymaster. \n\nIt does not seem that the suspicions of \nLeningrad have been aroused yet; but, un- \nfortunately for Le Chiffre, it is possible that at \nany rateSMERSH is on the scent. Last week a high- \ngrade source of Station P. reported that a senior \nofficial of the efficient organ of Soviet vengeance \nhad left Warsaw for Strasbourg via the Eastern \nsector of Berlin. There is no confirmation of this \nreport from the Deuxieme Bureau, nor from the \nauthorities in Strasbourg (who are reliable and \nthorough) and there is also no news from Le \nChiffre's headquarters there, which we have well \ncovered by a double agent (in addition to 1860). \n\nIf Le Chiffre knew that SMERSH was on his tail \nor that they had the smallest suspicion of him, he \nwould have no alternative to committing suicide \nor attempting to escape; but his present plans \nsuggest that, while he is certainly desperate, he \ndoes not yet realize that his life may be at stake. It \nis these rather spectacular plans of his that have \nsuggested to us a counter-operation which, though \nrisky and unconventional, we submit at the end of \nthis memorandum with confidence. \n\nIn brief, Le Chiffre plans, we believe, to follow \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nthe example of most other desperate till-robbers \nand make good the deficit in his accounts by gam- \nbling. The 'Bourse' is too slow. So are the various \nillicit traffics in drugs, or rare medicines, such as \naureo- and streptomycin and cortisone. No race \ntracks could carry the sort of stakes he will have to \nplay; and, if he won, he would more likely be \nkilled than paid off . \n\nIn any case, we know that he has withdrawn the \nfinal twenty-five million francs from the treasury \nof his union, and that he has taken a small villa in \nthe neighbourhood of Royale-les-Eaux, just north \nof Dieppe, for a week from a fortnight tomorrow. \n\nNow, it is expected that the Casino at Royale \nwill see the highest gambling in Europe this sum- \nmer. In an effort to wrest the big money from \nDeauville and Le Touquet, the Soci6te des Bains \nde Mers de Royale have leased the baccarat and \nthe two top chemin-de-fer tables to the Mahomet \nAli Syndicate, a group of emigre' Egyptian bankers \nand businessmen with, it is said, a call on certain \nroyal funds, who have for years been trying to cut \nin on the profits of Zographos and his Greek \nassociates resulting from their monopoly of the \nhighest French baccarat banks. \n\nWith the help of discreet publicity, a con- \nsiderable number of the biggest operators in \nAmerica and Europe have been encouraged to \nbook at Royale this summer and it seems possible \nthat this old-fashioned watering-place will regain \nsome of its Victorian renown. \n\nBe that as it may, it is here that Le Chiffre will, \nwe are confident, endeavour on or after 15 June to \nmake a profit at baccarat of fifty million francs on \na working capital of twenty- five million. (And, in- \ncidentally, save his life.) \n\n\n\nDOSSIER FOR M. \n\n\n\nProposed Counter-operation \n\nIt would be greatly in the interests of this coun- \ntry and of the other nations of the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization that this powerful Soviet \nagent should be ridiculed and destroyed, that his \ncommunist trade union should be bankrupted and \nbrought into disrepute, and that this potential \nfifth column, with a strength of 50,000, capable in \ntime of war of controlling a wide sector of \nFrance's northern frontier, should lose faith and \ncohesion. All this would result if Le Chiffre could \nbe defeated at the tables. (N.B. Assassination is \npointless. Leningrad would quickly cover up his \ndefalcations and make him into a martyr.) \n\nWe therefore recommend that the finest gam- \nbler available to the Service should be given the \nnecessary funds and endeavour to outgamble this \nman. \n\nThe risks are obvious, and the possible loss to \nthe Secret funds is high; but other operations on \nwhich large sums have been hazarded have had \nfewer chances of success, often for a smaller ob- \njective. \n\nIf the decision is unfavourable, the only alter- \nnative would be to place our information and our \nrecommendations in the hands of the Deuxieme \nBureau or of our American colleagues of the \nCombined Intelligence Agency in Washington. \nBoth of these organizations would doubtless be \ndelighted to take over the scheme. \n\nSigned: S. \n\n\n\nAppendix A. \nName: Le Chiffre. \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nAliases: Variations on the words 'cipher' or \n'number' in different languages; e.g., 'Herr \nZiffer.' \nOrigin: Unknown. \n\nFirst encountered as a displaced person, in- \nmate of Dachau D.P. camp in the U.S. Zone of \nGermany, June, 1945.

(formerly N.K.V.D.) \nand is believed to come under the personal \ndirection of Beria. \n\nHeadquarters: Leningrad (substation at \nMoscow). \n\nIts task is the elimination of all forms of \ntreachery and back-sliding within the various \nbranches of the Soviet Secret Service and Secret \nPolice at home and abroad. It is the most \npowerful and feared organization in the \nU.S.S.R. and is popularly believed never to \nhave failed in a mission of vengeance. \n\nIt is thought that SMERSH was responsible for \nthe assassination of Trotsky in Mexico (22 \nAugust 1940) and may indeed have made its \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nname with this successful murder after attempts \nby other Russian individuals and organizations \nhad failed. \n\nSMERSH was next heard of when Hitler at- \ntacked Russia. It was then rapidly expanded to \ncope with treachery and double agents during \nthe retreat of the Soviet forces in 1941. At that \ntime it worked as an execution squad for the \nN.K.V.D., and its present selective mission was \nnot so clearly defined. \n\nThe organization itself was thoroughly \npurged after the war and is now believed to con- \nsist of only a few hundred operatives of very \nhigh quality divided into five sections: \n\nDepartment I: In , charge of counter- \nintelligence among Soviet organizations \nat home and abroad. \n\nDepartment II: Operations, including execu- \ntions. \n\nDepartment III: Administration and Finance. \nDepartment IV: Investigations and legal \n\nwork. Personnel. \nDepartment V: Prosecutions: the section \n\nwhich passes final judgment on all victims. \n\nOnly one SMERSH operative has come into our \nhands since the war: Goytchev, alias Garrad- \nJones. He shot Petchora, medical officer at the \nYugoslav Embassy, in Hyde Park, 7 August \n1948. During interrogation he committed \nsuicide by swallowing a coat-button of com- \npressed potassium cyanide. He revealed nothing \nbeyond his membership of SMERSH, of which he \nwas arrogantly boastful-. \n\nWe believe that the following British double \nagents were victims of SMERSH: Donovan, \nHarthrop-Vane, Elizabeth Dumont, Ventnor, \n\n\n\nDOSSIER FOR M. \n\n\n\n17 \n\n\n\nMace, Savarin. (For details see Morgue: Section \n\nQ.) ' \n\nConclusion: Every effort should be made to im- \nprove our knowledge of this very powerful \norganization and destroy its operatives. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\nNumber 007 \n\n\n\nHead of S. (the section of the Secret Service con- \ncerned with the Soviet Union) was so keen on his plan \nfor the destruction of Le Chiffre, and it was basically \nhis own plan, that he took the memorandum himself \nand went up to the top floor of the gloomy building \noverlooking Regent's Park and through the green baize \ndoor and along the corridor to the end room. \n\nHe walked belligerently up to M.'s chief of staff, a \nyoung sapper who had earned his spurs as one of the \nsecretariat to the Chiefs of Staff committee after having \nbeen wounded during a sabotage operation in 1944, and \nhad kept his sense of humour in spite of . both ex- \nperiences.* \n\n'Now look here, Bill. I want to sell something to the \nChief. Is this a good moment?' \n\n'What do you think, Penny?' The Chief of Staff \nturned to M.'s private secretary, who shared the room \nwith him. \n\nMiss Moneypenny would have been desirable but for \n\n\n\n18 \n\n\n\nNUMBER 007 19 \n\nher eyes, which were cool and direct and quizzical. \n\n'Should be all right. He won a bit of a victory at the \nF.O. this morning and he's not. got anyone for the next \nhalf an hour.' She smiled encouragingly at Head of S., \nwhom she liked for himself and for the importance of \nhis section. \n\n'Well, here's the dope, Bill.' He handed over the \nblack folder with the red star which stood for Top \nSecret. 'And for God's sake look enthusiastic when you \ngive it him. And tell him I'll wait here and read a good \ncode-book while he's considering it. He may want some \nmore details, and anyway I want to see you two don't \npester him with anything else until he's finished. ' \n\n'All right, sir.' The Chief of Staff pressed a switch \nand leant towards the intercom on his desk. \n\n'Yes?' asked a quiet, flat voice. \n\n'Head of S. has an urgent docket for you, sir. ' \n\nThere was a pause. \n\n'Bring it in,' said the voice; \n\nThe Chief of Staff released the switch and stood up. \n\n'Thanks, Bill. I'll be next door,' said Head of S. \n\nThe Chief of Staff crossed his office and went \nthrough the double doors leading into M.'s room. In a \nmoment he came out, and over the entrance a small blue \nlight burned the warning that M. was not to be dis- \nturbed. \n\nLater, a triumphant Head of S. said to his Number \nTwo: 'We nearly cooked ourselves with that last \nparagraph. He said it was subversion and blackmail. He \ngot pretty sharp about it. Anyway, he approves. Says \nthe idea's crazy but worth trying if the Treasury will \nplay, and he thinks they will. He's going to tell them it's \na better gamble than the money we're putting into de- \nserting Russian colonels who turn double after a few \nmonths' \"asylum\" here. And he's longing to get at Le \nChiffre, and anyway he's got the right man and wants to \ntry him out on the job.' \\ \n\n\n\n20 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\n'Who is it?' asked Number Two. \n\n' One of the Double O's — I guess 007 . He's tough, and \nM. thinks there may be trouble with those gunmen of Le \nChiffre's. He must be pretty good with the cards, or he \nwouldn't have sat in the Casino in Monte Carlo for two \nmonths before the war watching that Roumanian team \nwork their stuff with the invisible ink and the dark \nglasses. He and the Deuxieme bowled them out in the \nend, and 007 turned in a million francs he had won at \nshemmy. Good money in those days. ' \n\nJames Bond's interview with M'. had been short. \n\n'What about it, Bond?' asked M. when Bond came \nback into his room after reading Head of S.'s memoran- \ndum and after gazing for ten minutes out of the waiting- \nroom window at the distant trees in the park. \n\nBond looked across the desk into the shrewd, clear \neyes. \n\n'It's very kind of you, sir, I'd like to do it. But I can't \npromise -to win. The odds at baccarat are the best after \n\"trente et quarante\" — evens except for the tiny \n\"cagnotte\" — but I might get a bad run against me and \nget cleaned out. Play's going to be pretty \nhigh— opening' 11 go up to half a million, I should \nthink.' \n\nBond was stopped by the cold eyes. M. knew all this \nalready, knew the odds at baccarat as well as Bond. \nThat was his job — knowing the odds at everything, and \nknowing men, his own and the opposition's. Bond \nwished he had kept quiet about his misgivings. \n\n'He can have a bad run too,' said M. 'You'll have \nplenty of capital. Up to twenty-five million, the same as \nhim. We'll start you on ten and send you another ten \nwhen you've had a look round. You can make the extra \nfive yourself.' He smiled. 'Go over a few days before \nthe big game starts and get your hand in. Have a talk to \nQ. about rooms and trains, and any equipment you \nwant. The Paymaster will fix the funds. I'm going to ask \n\n\n\nNUMBER 007 \n\n\n\n21 \n\n\n\nthe Deuxieme to stand by. It's their territory, and as it is \nwe shall be lucky if they don't kick up rough . I'll try and \npersuade them to send Mathis. You seemed to get on \nwell with him in Monte Carlo on that other Casino job. \nAnd I'm going to tell Washington because of the \nN.A.T.O. angle. C.I. A. have got one or two good men \nat Fontainebleau with the joint intelligence chaps there. \nAnything else?' \n\nBond shook his head. 'I'd certainly like to have \nMathis, sir.' \n\n'Well, we'll see. Try and bring it off. We're going to \nlook pretty foolish if you don't. And watch out. This \nsounds an amusing job, but I don't think it's going to \nbe. Le Chiffre is a good man. Well, best of luck.' \n\n'Thank you, sir,' said Bond, and went to the door. \n\n'Just a minute.' \n\nBond turned. \n\n'I think I'll keep you covered, Bond. Two heads are \nbetter than one and you'll need someone to run your \ncommunications. I'll think it over. They'll get in touch \ni with you at Royale. You needn't worry. It'll be someone \ngood.' \n\nBond would have preferred to work alone, but one \ndidn't argue with M. He left the room hoping that the \nman they sent would be loyal to.him and neither stupid \nnor, worse still, ambitious. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 \n\n'L'Ennemi Ecoute' \n\n\n\nAs, two weeks later, James Bond awoke in his \nroom at the Hotel Splehdide, some of this history \npassed through his mind. \n\nHe had arrived at Royale-les-Eaux in time for lunch- \neon two days before. There had been no attempt to con- \ntact him, and there had been no flicker of curiosity \nwhen he had signed the register 'James Bond, Port \nMaria, Jamaica.' \n\nM. had expressed no interest in his cover. \n\n'Once you start to make a set at Le Chiffre at the \ntables you'll have had it,' he said. 'But wear a cover that \nwill stick with the general public. ' \n\nBond knew Jamaica well, so he asked to be controlled \nfrom there and to pass as a Jamaican phantocrat whose \nfather had made his pile in tobacco and sugar and who \nchose to play it away on the stock markets and in \ncasinos. If inquiries were made, he would quote Charles \nDasilva of Caffery's, Kingston, as his attorney. Charles \nwould make the story stick. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n\n\n'L'ENNEMI ECOUTE' \n\n\n\n23 \n\n\n\nBond had spent the last two afternoons and most of \nthe nights at the Casino, playing complicated \nprogression systems on the even chances at roulette. He \nmade a high banco at chemin-de-fer whenever he heard \none offered. If he lost, he would 'suivi' once and not \nchase it further if he lost the second time. \n\nIn this way he had made some three million francs \nand had given his nerves and card-sense a thorough \nworkout. He had got the geography of the Casino clear \nin his mind. Above all, he had been able to observe Le \nChiffre at the tables and to note ruefully that he was a \nfaultless and lucky gambler. \n\nBond liked to make a good breakfast. After a cold \nshower, he- sat at the writing-table in front of the \nwindow. He looked out at the beautiful day and con- \nsumed half a pint of iced orange juice, three scrambled \neggs and bacon, and a double portion of coffee without \nsugar. He lit his first cigarette, a Balkan and Turkish \nmixture made for him by Morlands of Grosvenor Street, \nand watched the small waves lick the long seashore and \nthe fishing fleet from Dieppe string out towards the \nJune heat-haze followed by a paper-chase of herring- \ngulls. \n\nHe was lost in his thoughts when the telephone rang. \nIt was the concierge announcing that a Director of \nRadio Stentor was waiting below with the wireless set he \nv had ordered from Paris. \n\n'Of course,' said Bond. 'Send him up.' \n\nThis was the cover fixed by the Deuxieme Bureau for \ntheir liaison man with Bond. Bond watched the door, \nhoping that it would be Mathis. \n\nWhen Mathis came in, a respectable businessman \ncarrying a large square parcel by its leather handle, \nBond smiled broadly and would have greeted him with \nwarmth if Mathis had not frowned and held up his free \nhand after carefully closing the door. \n\n'I have just arrived from Paris, monsieur, and here is \nthe set you asked to have on approval — five valves, \n\n\n\ni. \n\n\n\n24 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nsuperhet, I think you call it in England, and you should \nbe able to get most of the capitals of Europe from \nRoyale. There are no mountains for forty miles in any \ndirection.' \n\n'It sounds all right,' said Bond, lifting his eyebrows at \nthis mystery-making. \n\nMathis paid no attention. He placed the set, which he \nhad unwrapped, on the floor beside the unlit panel elec- \ntric fire below the mantelpiece. \n\n'It is just past eleven,' he said, 'and I see that the \nCompagnons de la Chanson should now be on the \nmedium wave from Rome. They are touring Europe. \nLet us see what the reception is like. It should be a fair \ntest.' \n\nHe winked. Bond noticed that he had turned the \nvolume on to full and that the red light indicating the \nlong waveband was illuminated, though the set was still \nsilent. \n\nMathis fiddled at the back of the set. Suddenly an ap- \npalling roar of static filled the small room. Mathis gazed \nat the set for a few seconds with benevolence and then \nturned it off, and his voice was full of dismay. \n\n'My dear monsieur — forgive me, please— badly \ntuned.' And he again bent to the dials. After a few ad- \njustments the close harmony of the French came over \nthe air, and Mathis walked up and clapped Bond very \nhard on the back and wrung his hand until Bond's \nfingers ached. \n\nBond smiled back at him. 'Now what the hell?' he \nasked. \n\n'My dear friend,' Mathis was delighted, 'you are \nblown, blown, blown. Up there,' he pointed at the \nceiling, 'at this moment, either Monsieur Muntz or his \nalleged wife, allegedly bedridden with the grippe, is \ndeafened, absolutely deafened, and I hope in agony.' \nHe grinned with pleasure at Bond's frown of disbelief. \n\nMathis sat down on the bed and ripped open a packet \nof Caporal with his thumbnail. Bond waited. \n\n\n\n•L'ENNEMI ECOUTE' \n\n\n\n25 \n\n\n\nMathis was satisfied with the sensation his words had \ncaused. He became serious. \n\n'How it has happened, I don't know. They must have \nbeen on to you for several days before you arrived. The \nopposition is here in real strength. Above you is the \nMuntz family. He is German. She is from somewhere in \nCentral Europe, perhaps a Czech. This is an old- \nfashioned hotel. There are disused chimneys behind \nthese electric fires. Just here,' he pointed a few inches \nabove the panel fire, 'is suspended a very powerful radio \npick-up. The wires run up the chimney to behind the \nMuntzes' electric fire where there is an amplifier. In \ntheir room is a wire recorder and a pair of earphones on \nwhich the Muntzes listen in turn. That is why Madame \nMuntz has the grippe and takes all her meals in bed and \nwhy Monsieur Muntz has to be constantly at her side in- \nstead of enjoying the sunshine and the gambling of this \ndelightful resort. \n\n'Some of this we knew because in France we are very \nclever. The rest we confirmed by unscrewing your elec- \ntric fire a few hours before you got here. ' \n\nSuspiciously Bond walked over and examined the \nscrews which secured the panel to the wall. Their \ngrooves showed minute scratches. \n\n'Now it is time for a little more play-acting,' said \nMathis. He walked over to the radio, which was still \ntransmitting close harmony to its audience of three, and \nswitched it off. \n\n'Are you satisfied, monsieur?' he asked. 'You notice \nhow clearly they come over. Are they not a wonderful \nteam?' He made a winding motion with his right hand \nand raised his eyebrows. \n\n'They are so good;' said Bond, 'that I would like to \nhear the rest of the programme.' He grinned at the \nthought of the angry glances which the Muntzes must be \nexchanging overhead. 'The machine itself seems splen- \ndid. Just what I was looking for to take back to \nJamaica.' ' \n\n\n\n26 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nMathis made a sarcastic grimace and switched back to \nthe Rome programme. \n\n'You and your Jamaica,' he said, and sat down again \non the bed. \n\nBond frowned at him. 'Well, it's no good crying over \nspilt milk,' he said. 'We didn't expect the cover to stick \nfor long, but it's worrying that they bowled it out so \nsoon.' He searched his mind in vain for a clue. Could \nthe Russians have broken one of our ciphers? If so, he \nmight just as well pack up and go home. He and his job \nwould have been stripped naked. \n\nMathis seemed to read his mind. 'It can't have been a \ncipher,' he said. 'Anyway, we told London at once, and \nthey will have changed them. A pretty flap we caused, I \ncan tell you.' He smiled with the satisfaction of a \nfriendly rival. 'And now to business, before our good \nCompagnons run out of breath. \n\n'First of all' — he inhaled a thick lungful of \nCaporal — 'you will be pleased with your Number Two. \nShe is very beautiful (Bond frowned), very beautiful in- \ndeed.' Satisfied with Bond's reaction, Mathis con- \ntinued: 'She has black hair, blue eyes, and splendid ... \ner . . . protuberances. Back and front,' he added. 'And \nshe is a wireless expert which, though sexually less in- \nteresting, makes her a perfect employee of Radio \nStentor and assistant to myself in my capacity as \nwireless salesman for this rich summer season down \nhere.' He grinned. 'We are both staying in the hotel, \nand my assistant will thus be on hand in case your new \nradio breaks down. All new machines, even French \nones, are apt to have teething troubles in the first day or \ntwo. And occasionally at night,' he added with an \nexaggerated wink. \n\nBond was not amused. 'What the hell do they want to \nsend me a woman for,' he said bitterly. 'Do they think \nthis is a bloody picnic?' \n\nMathis interrupted. 'Calm yourself, my dear James. \nShe is as serious as you could wish and as cold as an \n\n\n\n'L'ENNEMI ECOUTE' \n\n\n\n27 \n\n\n\nicicle. She speaks French like a native and knows her job \nbackwards. Her cover's perfect, and I have arranged for \nher to team up with you \"quite smoothly. What is more \nnatural than that you should pick up a pretty girl here? \nAs a Jamaican millionaire\/ he coughed respectfully, \n'what with your hot blood and all, you would look \nnaked without one.' \n\nBond grunted dubiously. \n\n'Any other surprises?' he asked suspiciously. \n\n' Nothing very much,' answered Mathis. 'LeChiffre is \ninstalled in his villa. It's about ten miles down the coast \nroad. He had his two guards with him. They look pretty \ncapable fellows. One of them has been seen visiting a \nlittle pension in the town where three mysterious and \nrather subhuman characters checked in two days ago. \nThey may be part of the team. Their papers are in or- \nder — stateless Czechs apparently — but one of our men \nsays the language they talk in their room is Bulgarian. \nWe don't see many of those around. They're mostly \nused against the Turks and the Yugoslavs. They're \nstupid, but obedient. The Russians use them for simple \nkillings or as fall-guys for more complicated ones.' \n\n'Thanks very much. Which is mine to be?' asked \nBond. 'Anything else?' \n\n'No. Come to the bar of the Hermitage before lunch. \nI'll fix the introduction. Ask her to dinner this evening. \nThen it will be natural for her to come into the Casino \nwith you. I'll be there too, but in the background. I've \ngot one or two good chaps, and we'll keep an eye on \nyou. Oh, and there's an American called Leiter here, \nstaying in the hotel. Felix Leiter. He's the C.I. A. chap \nfrom Fontainebleau. London told me to tell you. He \nlooks okay. May come in useful. ' \n\nA torrent of Italian burst from the wireless set on the \nfloor. Mathis switched it off and they exchanged some \nphrases about the set and about how Bond should pay \nfor it. Then with effusive farewells and a final wink \nMathis bowed himself out. \n\n\n\n28 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nBond sat at the window and gathered his thoughts. \nNothing that Mathis had told him was reassut^ng. He \nwas completely blown and under really professional sur- \nveillance. An attempt might be made to put him away \neven before he had a chance to pit himself against Le \nChiffre at the tables. The Russians had no stupid \nprejudices about murder. And then there was this pest \nof a girl. He sighed. Women were for recreation. On a \njob, they got in the;; way and fogged things up with sex \nand hurt feelings and all the emotional baggage they \ncarried around. One had to look out for them and take \ncare of them. - \n\n'Bitch,' said Bond, and then remembering the \nMuntzes, he said 'bitch' again more loudly and walked \nout of the room. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 . \n\nThe Girl from Headquarters \n\n\n\nIt was twelve o'clock when Bond left the Splen- \ndide, and the clock on the mairie was stumbling through \nits midday carillon. There was a strong scent of pine and \nmimosa in the air, and the freshly watered gardens of \nthe Casino opposite, interspersed with neat gravel par- \nterres and paths, lent the scene a pretty formalism more \nappropriate to ballet than to melodrama. \n\nThe sun shone, and there was a gaiety and sparkle in \nthe air which seemed to promise well for the new era of \nfashion and prosperity for which the little seaside town, \nafter many vicissitudes, was making its gallant bid. \n\nRoyale-les-Eaux, which lies near the mouth of the \nSomme before the flat coast-line soars up from the \nbeaches of southern Picardy to the Brittany cliffs which \nrun on to Le Havre, had experienced much the same \nfortunes as Trouville. \n\nRoyale (without the Eaux) also started as a small \nfishing-village, and its rise to fame as a fashionable \nwatering-place during the Second Empire was as \n\n\n\n29 \n\n\n\n30 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nmeteoric as that of Trouville. But as Deauville killed \nTrouville, so, after a long period of decline,; did Le \nTouquet kill Royale. \n\nAt the turn pf the century, when things were going \nbadly for the little seaside town and when the fashion \nwas to combine pleasure with a 'cure,' a natural spring \nin the hills behind Royale was discovered to contain \nenough diluted sulphur to have a beneficent effect on \nthe liver. Since all French people suffer from liver com- \nplaints, Royale quickly became Royale-les-Eaux, and \nEau Royale, in a torpedo-shaped bottle, grafted itself \ndemurely on to the tail of the mineral-water lists in \nhotels and restaurant cars. \n\nIt did not long withstand the powerful combines of \nVichy and Perrier and Vittel. There came a series of \nlawsuits; a number \"of people lost a lot of money, and \nvery soon its sale was again entirely local. Royale fell \nback on the takings from French and English families \nv during the summer, on its fishing-fleet in winter and on \nthe crumbs which fell to its elegantly dilapidated Casino \nfrom the tables at Le Touquet. \n\nBut there was something splendid about the Negresco \nbaroque of the Casino Royale, a strong whiff of Vic- \ntorian elegance and luxury, and in 1950 Royale caught, \nthe fancy of a syndicate in Paris which disposed of large \nfunds belonging to a group of expatriate Vichyites. \n\nBrighton had been revived since the war, and Nice. \nNostalgia for more specious, golden times might be a \nsource of revenue. \n\nThe Casino was repainted in its original white and \ngilt, and the rooms decorated in the palest grey with \nwine-red carpets and curtains. Vast chandeliers were \nsuspended from the ceilings. The gardens were spruced, \nand the fountains played again, and the two main \nhotels, the Splendide and the Hermitage, were prinked \nand furbished and restaffed. \n\nEven the small town and the vieux-port managed to \nfix welcoming smiles across their ravaged faces, and the \n\n\n\nTHE GIRL FROM HEADQUARTERS \n\n\n\n31 \n\n\n\nmain street became gay with the 'vitrines' of great Paris \njewellers and couturiers, tempted down for a butterfly \nseason by rent-free sites and lavish promises. \n\nThen the Mahomet Ali Syndicate was cajoled into \nstarting a high game in the Casino and the Socie\"te des \nBains de Mer de Royale felt that now at last Le Touquet \nwould have to yield up some of the treasure stolen over \nthe years from its parent plage. \n\nAgainst the background of this luminous and \nsparkling stage Bond stood in the sunshine and felt his \nmission to be incongruous and remote and his dark \nprofession an affront to his fellow actors. \n\nHe shrugged away the momentary feeling of unease \nand walked round the back of his hotel and down the \nramp to the garage. Before his rendezvous at the Her- \nmitage he decided to take his car down the coast road \nand have a quick look at Le Chiffre's villa and then \ndrive back by the inland road until it crossed the route \nnationale to Paris. \n\nBond's car was his only personal hobby. One of the \nlast of the 4'\/i-litre Bentleys with the supercharger by \nAmherst Villiers, he had bought it almost new in 1933 \nand had kept it in careful storage through the war. It \nwas still serviced every year and, in London, a former \nBentley mechanic, who worked in a garage near Bond's \nChelsea flat, tended it with jealous care. Bond drove it \nhard and well and with an almost sensual pleasure. It \nwas a battleship-grey convertible coupe, which really \ndid convert, and it was capable of touring at ninety with \nthirty miles an hour in reserve. \n\nBond eased the car out of the garage and up the ramp, \nand soon the loitering drumbeat of the two-inch exhaust \nwas echoing down the tree-lined boulevard, through the \ncrowded main street of the little town, and off through \nthe sand dunes to the south. \n\nAn hour later, Bond walked into the Hermitage bar \nand chose a table near one of the broad windows. \n\nThe room was sumptuous with those overmasculine \n\n\n\n32 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\ntrappings which, together with briar pipes and wire- \nhaired terriers, spell luxury in France. Everything was \nbrass-studded leather and polished mahogany. The cur- \ntains and carpets were in royal blue! The waiters wore \nstriped waistcoats and green baize aprons. Bond or- \ndered an Americano and examined the sprinkling of \noverdressed customers, mostly from Paris he guessed, \nwho sat talking with focus and vivacity, creating that \ntheatrically clubbable atmosphere of Pheure de \nl'aperitif. \n\nThe men were drinking inexhaustible quarter-bottles \nof champagne, the women dry Martinis. \n\n'Moi, j'adore le \"dry,\" ' a bright-faced girl at the \nnext table said to her companion, too neat in his un- \nseasonable tweeds, who gazed at her with moist brown \neyes over the top of an expensive shooting-stick from \nHermes, 'fait avec du Gordon's, bien entendu.' \n\n'D'accord, Daisy. Mais tu sais, un zeste de citron \n\nBond's eye was caught by the tall figure of Mathis on \nthe pavement outside, his face turned in animation to a \ndark haired girl in grey. His arm was linked in hers, high \nUp above the elbow, and yet there was a lack of intimacy \nin their appearance, an ironical chill in the girl's profile, \nwhich made them seem two separate people rather than \na couple. Bond waited for them to come through the \nstreet-door into the bar, but for appearances' sake con- \ntinued to stare out of the window at the passers-by. \n\n'But surely it is Monsieur Bond?' Mathis's Voice \nbehind him was full of surprised delight. Bond, ap- \npropriately flustered, rose to his feet. 'Can it be that you \nare alone? Are you awaiting someone? May I present \nmy colleague, Mademoiselle Lynd? My dear, this is the \ngentleman from Jamaica with whom I had the pleasure \nof doing business this morning.' \n\nBond inclined himself with a reserved friendliness. 'It \nwould be a great pleasure,' he addressed himself to the \ngirl. 'I am alone. Would you both care to join me?' He \npulled out a chair, and while they sat down he beckoned \n\n\n\nTHE GIRL FROM HEADQUARTERS \n\n\n\n33 \n\n\n\nto a waiter and despite Mathis's expostulations insisted \non ordering the drinks— a fine a l'eau for Mathis and a \nBacardi for the girl. \n\nMathis and Bond exchanged cheerful talk about the \nfine weather and the prospects of a revival in the for- x \ntunes of Royale-les-Eaux. The girl sat silent. She ac- \ncepted pne of Bond's cigarettes, examined it, and then \nsmoked it appreciatively and without affectation, \ndrawing the smoke deeply into her lungs with, a little \nsigh and then exhaling it casually through her lips and \nnostrils. Her movements were economical and precise \nwith no trace of self-consciousness. \n\nBond felt her presence strongly. While he and Mathis \ntalked, he turned from time to time towards her, \npolitely including her in the conversation, but adding up \nthe impressions recorded by each glance. \n\nHer hair was very black, and she wore it cut square \nand low on the nape of the neck, framing her face to \nbelow the clear and beautiful line of her jaw. Although \nit was heavy and moved with the movements of her \nhead, she did not constantly pat it back into place, but \nlet it alone. Her eyes were wide apart and deep blue, and \nthey gazed candidly back at Bond with a touch of \nironical disinterest which, to his annoyance, he found he \nwould like to shatter, roughly. Her skin was lightly sun- \ntanned and bore no trace of makeup except on her \nmouth, which was wide and sensual. Her bare arms and \nhands had a quality of repose, and the general im- \npression Of restraint in her appearance and movements \nwas carried even to her fingernails, which were un- \npainted and cut short. Round her neck she wore a plain \ngold chain of wide flat links, and on the fourth finger of \nthe right hand a broad topaz ring. Her medium-length \ndress was of grey soie sauvage with a square-cut bodice, \nlasciviously tight across her fine breasts. The skirt Was \nclosely pleated and flowered down from a narrow, but \nnot^a thin, waist. She wore a three-inch, hand-stitched \nblack belt. A hand-stitched black sabretache rested on \n\n\n\n34 CASINO ROYALE \n\nthe chair beside her, together with a wide cartwheel hat \nof gold straw, its crown encircled by a thin black velvet \nribbon which tied at the back in a short bow. Her shoes \nwere square-toed of plain black leather. \n\nBond was excited by her beauty and intrigued by her \ncomposure. The prospect of working with her \nstimulated him. At the same time he felt a vague \ndisquiet. On an impulse he touched wood. \n\nMathis had noticed Bond's preoccupation. After a \ntime he rose. \n\n'Forgive me, ' he said to the girl, 'while I telephone to \nthe Dubernes. I must arrange my rendezvous for dinner \ntonight. Are you sure you won't mind being left to your \nown devices this evening?' \n\nShe shook her head. - \n\nBond took the cue and, as Mathis crossed the room to \nthe telephone booth beside the bar, he said: 'If you are \ngoing to be alone tonight, would you care to have dinner \nwith me?' \n\nShe smiled with the first hint of conspiracy she had \nshown. 'I would like to very much,' she said, 'and then \nperhaps you would chaperon me to the Casino where \nMonsieur Mathis tells me you are very much at home. \nPerhaps I will bring you luck.' \n\nWith Mathis gone, her attitude towards him showed a \nsudden warmth. She seemed to acknowledge that they \nwere a team and, as they discussed the time and place of \ntheir meeting, Bond realized that it would be quite easy \nafter all to plan the details of his project with her. He \nfelt that after all she was interested and excited by her \nrole and that she would work willingly with him. He had \nimagined many hurdles before establishing a rapport, \nbut now he felt he could get straight down to \nprofessional details. He was quite honest to himself \nabout the hypocrisy of his attitude towards her. As a \nwoman, he wanted to sleep with her, but only when the \njob had been done. \n\nWhen Mathis came back to the table Bond called for \n\n\n\nTHE GIRL FROM HEADQUARTERS \n\n\n\n35 \n\n\n\nhis bill. He explained that he was expected back at his \nhotel to have lunch with friends. When for a moment he \nheld her hand in his he felt a warmth of affection and \nunderstanding pass between them that would have \nseemed impossible half an hour earlier. \n\nThe girl's eyes followed him out on to the boulevard. \n\nMathis moved his chair close to hers and said softly: \n'That is a very good friend of mine. I am glad you have \nmet each other. I can already feel the ice-floes on the \ntwo rivers breaking up.' He smiled. 'I don't think Bond \nhas ever been melted. It will be a new experience for \nhim. And for you.' \n\nShe did not answer him directly. \n\n'He is very good-looking. He reminds me rather of \nHoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and \nruthless in his ... ' \n\nThe sentence was never finished. Suddenly a few feet \n, away the entire plate-glass window shivered into con- \nfetti. The blast of a terrific explosion, very near, hit \nthem so that they were rocked back in their chairs. \nThere was an instant of silence. Some objects pattered \ndown on to the pavement outside. Bottles slowly \ntoppled off the shelves behind the bar. Then there were \nscreams and a stampede for the door. \n\n'Stay there,' said Mathis. \n\nHe kicked back his chair and hurtled through the \nempty window-frame on to the payment. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 \n\nTwo Men in Straw Hats \n\n\n\nWhen Bond left the bar he walked purposefully \nalong the pavement flanking the tree-lined boulevard \ntowards his hotel a few hundred yards away. He was \nhungry. \n\nThe day was still beautiful, but by now the sun was \nvery hot and the plane-trees, spaced about twenty feet \napart on the grass verge between the pavement and the \nbroad tarmac, gave a cool shade. \n\nThere were few people abroad and the two men stand- \ning quietly under a tree on the opposite side of the \nboulevard looked out of place. \n\nBond noticed them when he was still a hundred yards \naway and when the same distance separated them from \nthe ornamental 'porte-cochere' of the Splendide. \n\nThere was something rather disquieting about their \nappearance. They were both small, and they were \ndressed alike in dark and, Bond reflected, rather hot- \nlooking suits. They had the appearance of a variety turn \nwaiting for a bus on the way to the theatre. Each wore a \n\n\n\n36 \n\n\n\nTWO MEN IN STRAW HATS \n\n\n\n37 \n\n\n\nstraw hat with a thick black ribbon as a concession, \nperhaps, to the holiday atmosphere of the resort, and \nthe. brims of these and the shadow from the tree under \nwhich they stood obscured their faces. Incongruously, \neach dark, squat little figure was illuminated by a touch \nof bright colour. They were both carrying square \ncamera-cases slung from the shoulder. \n\nAnd one case was bright red and the other case bright \nblue. \n\nBy the time Bond had taken in these details, he had \ncome to within fifty yards of the two men. He was \nreflecting on the ranges of various types of weapon and \nthe possibilities of cover when an extraordinary and \nterrible scene was enacted. \n\nRed-man seemed to give a short nod to Blue-man. \nWith a quick movement Blue-man unslung his blue \ncamera case. Blue-man, and Bond could not see exactly \nas the trunk of a plane-tree beside him just then in- \ntervened to obscure his vision, bent forward and seemed , \nto fiddle with the case. Then with a blinding flash of \nwhite light there was the ear-splitting crack of a mon- \nstrous explosion and Bond, despite the protection of the \ntree-trunk, was slammed down to the pavement by a \nsolid bolt of hot air which dented his cheeks and \nstomach as if they had been made of paper. He lay, \ngazing up at the sun, while the air (or so it seemed to \nhim) went on twanging with the explosion as if someone \nhad hit the bass register of a piano with a sledge \nhammer. < \n\nWhen, dazed and half-conscious, he raised himself on \none knee, a ghastly rain of pieces of flesh and shreds of \nblood-soaked clothing fell on him and around him, \nmingled with branches and gravel. Then a shower ^ of \nsmall twigs and leaves. From all sides came the sharp \ntinkle of falling glass. Above in the sky hung a \nmushroom of black smoke which rose and dissolved as \nhe drunkenly watched it. There was an obscene smell of \nhigh explosive, of burning wood, and of, yes, that was \n\n\n\n38 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nit— roast mutton. For fifty yards down the boulevard \nthe trees were leafless and charred. Opposite, two of \nthem had snapped off near the base and lay drunkenly \nacross the road. Between them there was a still smoking \ncrater. Of the two men in straw hats, there remained ab- \nsolutely nothing. But there were red traces on the road, \nand on the pavements and against the trunks of the \ntrees, and there were glittering shreds high up in the \nbranches. \n\nBond felt himself starting to vomit. \n\nIt was Mathis who got to him first, and by that time \nBond was standing with his arm round the tree which \nhad saved his life. \n\nStupefied, but unharmed, he allowed Mathis to lead \nhim off towards the Splendide from which guests and \nservants were pouring in chattering fright. As the \ndistant clang of bells heralded the arrival of ambulances \nand fire-engines, they managed to push through the \nthrong and up the short stairs and along the corridor to \nBond's room. \n\nMathis paused only to turn on the radio in front of \nthe fireplace, then, while Bond stripped off his blood- \nflecked clothes, Mathis sprayed him with questions. \n\nWhen it came to the description of the two men, \nMathis tore the telephone off its hook beside Bond's \nbed. \n\n. . and tell the police,' he concluded, 'tell them that \nthe Englishman from Jamaica who was knocked over by \nthe blast is my affair. He is unhurt, and they are not to \nworry him. I will explain to them in half an hour. They \nshould tell the Press that it was apparently a vendetta \nbetween two Bulgarian communists and that one killed \nthe other with a bomb. They need say nothing of the \nthird Bulgar who must have been hanging about \nsomewhere, but they must get him at all costs. He will \ncertainly head for Paris. Roadblocks everywhere. Un- \nderstood? Alors, bonne chance.' \n\n\n\nTWO MEN IN STRAW HATS \n\n\n\n39 \n\n\n\nMathis turned back to Bond and heard him to the \nend. \n\n'Merde, but you were lucky,' he said when Bond had \nfinished. 'Clearly the bomb was intended for you. It \nmust have been faulty. They intended to throw it and \nthen dodge behind their tree. But it all came out the \nother way round. Never mind. We will discover the \nfacts.' He paused. 'But certainly it is a curious affair. \nAnd these people appear to be taking you seriously.' \nMathis looked affronted. 'But how did these sacre\" \nBulgars intend to escape capture? And what was the \nsignificance of the red and the blue cases? We must try \nand find some fragments of the red one.' \n\nMathis bit his nails. He was excited, and his eyes glit- \ntered. This was becoming a formidable and dramatic af- \nfair, in many aspects of which he was now involved per- \nsonally. Certainly it was no longer just a case of holding \nBond's coat while he had his private battle with Le \nChiffre in the Casino. Mathis jumped up. \n\n'Now get a drink and some lunch and a rest,' he or- \ndered Bond. 'For me, I must get my nose quickly into \nthis affair before the police have muddied the trail with \ntheir big black boots.' \n\nMathis turned off the radio and waved an af- \nfectionate farewell. The door slammed, and silence set- \ntled on the room. Bond sat for a while by the window \nand enjoyed being alive. \n\nLater, as Bond was finishing his first straight whisky \n'on the rocks' and was contemplating the p§te de foie . \ngras and cold langouste which the waiter had just laid \nout for him, the telephone rang. \n\n'This is Mademoiselle Lynd.' \n\nThe voice was low and anxious. \n\n'Are you all right?' \n\n'Yes, quite.' \n\n'I'm glad: Please take care of yourself.' \nShe rang off. \n\n\n\n40 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nBond shook himself, then he picked up his knife and \nselected the thickest of the pieces of hot toast . \n\nHe suddenly thought: two of them are dead, and I \nhave got one more on my side. It's a start. \n\nHe dipped the knife into the glass of very hot water \nwhich stood beside the pot of Strasbourg porcelain and \nreminded himself to tip the waiter doubly for this par- \nticular meal. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7 \n\n\n\nRouge et Noir \n\n\n\nBond was determined to be completely fit and \nrelaxed for a gambling session which might last most of \nthe night. He ordered a masseur for three o'clock. After \nthe remains of his luncheon had been removed, he sat at \nhis window gazing out to sea until there came a knock \non the door as the masseur, a Swede, presented himself. \n\nSilently he got to work on Bond from his feet to his \nneck, melting the tensions in his body and calming his \nstill twanging nerves. Even the long purpling bruises \ndown Bond's left shoulder and side ceased to throb, and \nwhen the Swede had gone Bond fell into a dreamless \nsleep. \n\nHe awoke in the evening completely refreshed. \n\nAfter a cold shower, Bond walked over to the Casino. \nSince the night before he had lost the mood of the \ntables. He needed to reestablish that focus which is half \nmathematical and half intuitive and which, with a slow \npulse and a sanguine temperament, he knew to be the \n\n\n\n41 \n\n\n\n42 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nessential equipment of any gambler who was set on \nwinning. \n\nBond had always been a gambler. He loved the dry \nriffle of the cards and the constant unemphatic drama \nof the quiet figures round the green tables. He liked the \nsolid, studied comfort of cardrooms and casinos, the \nwell-padded arms of the chairs, the glass of champagne \nor whisky at the elbow, the quiet unhurried attention of \ngood servants. He was amused by the impartiality of the \nroulette ball and of the playing cards — and their eternal \nbias. He liked being an actor and a spectator and from \nhis chair to take part in other men's dramas and \ndecisions, until it came to his own turn to say that vital \n'yes' or 'no,' generally on a fifty-fifty chance. \n\nAbove all, he liked it that everything was one's own \nfault. There was only oneself to praise or blame. Luck \nwas a servant and not a master. Luck had to be accepted \nwith a shrug or taken advantage of up to the hilt. But it \nhad to be understood and recognized for what it was \nand not confused with a faulty appreciation of the odds, \n, for, at gambling, the deadly sin is to mistake bad play \nfor bad luck. And luck in all its moods had to be loved \nand not feared. Bond saw luck as a woman, to be softly \nwooed or brutally ravaged, never pandered to or pur- \nsued. But he was honest enough to, admit that he had \nnever yet been made to suffer by cards or by women. \nOne day, and he accepted the fact, he would be brought \nto his knees by love or by luck. When that happened he \nknew that he too would be branded with the deadly \nquestion-mark he recognized so often in others, the \npromise to -pay before you have lost: the acceptance of \nfallibility. ^ \n\nBut on this June evening when Bond walked through \nthe 'kitchen' into the salle priv6e, it was with a sensation \nof confidence and cheerful anticipation that he changed \na million francs into plaques of fifty mille and took a \n\n\n\n: ,ROUGEETNOIR \n\n\n\n43 \n\n\n\nseat next to the chef de partie at Roulette. Table \nNumber 1. . \n\nBond borrowed the chef's card and studied the run of \nthe ball since the session had started at three o'clock \nthat afternoon. He always did this although he knew \nthat- each turn of the wheel, each fall of the ball into a \nnumbered slot, had absolutely no connexion with its \npredecessor. He accepted that the game begins afresh \neach time the croupier picks up the ivory ball with his \nright hand, gives one of the four spokes of the wheel a \ncontrolled twist clockwise with the same hand and, with \na third motion, also with the right hand, flicks the ball \nround the outer rim of the wheel anticlockwise, against \nits spin. \n\nIt was obvious that all this ritual and all the \nmechanical minutiae of the wheel, of the numbered slots \nand the cylinder, had been devised and perfected over \nthe years so that neither the skill of the croupier nor any \nbias in the wheel could affect the fall of the ball. And \nyet it is a convention among roulette players, and Bond \nrigidly adhered to it, to take careful note of the past \nhistory of each session and to be guided by any pe- \nculiarities in the run of the wheel. To note, for instance, \nand consider significant, sequences of more than two on \na single number or of more than four at the other \nchances down to evens. \n\nBond didn't defend the practice. He simply main- \ntained that the more effort and ingenuity you put into \ngambling, the more you took out. \n\nOn the record of that particular table, after about \nthree hours' play, Bond could see little of interest except \nthat the last dozen had been out of favour, It was his \npractice to play always with the wheel, and only to turn \nagainst its previous pattern and start on a new tack after \na zero had turned up. So he decided to play one of his \nfavourite gambits and back two— in this case the first \n\n\n\n44 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\ntwo— dozens, each with the maximum— one hundred \nthousand francs. He thus had two-thirds of the board \ncovered (less the zero) and, since the dozens pay odds of \ntwo to one, he stood to win a hundred thousand francs \nevery time any number lower than 25 turned up. \n\nAfter seven coups he had won six times. He lost on \nthe seventh When 30 came up. His net profit was half a \nmillion francs. He kept off the table for the eighth \nthrow. Zero turned up. This piece of luck cheered him \nfurther and, accepting the 30 as a finger-post to the last \ndozen, he decided to back the first and last dozens until \nhe had lost twice. Ten throws later the middle dozen \ncame up twice, costing him four hundred thousand \nfrancs, but he rose from the table eleven hundred \nthousand francs to the good. \n\nDirectly Bond had started playing in maximums, his \ngame had become the centre of interest at the table. As \nhe seemed to be in luck, one or two pilot fish started to \nswim with the shark. Sitting directly opposite, one of \nthese, whom Bond took to be \"an American, had shown \nmore than the usual friendliness and pleasure at his \nshare of the winning streak. He had smiled once or twice \nacross the table, and there was something pointed in the \nway he duplicated Bond's movements, placing his two \nmodest plaques of ten mille exactly opposite Bond's \nlarger ones. When Bond rose, he too pushed back his \nchair and called cheerfully across the table: \n\n'Thanks for the ride. Guess I owe you a drink. Will \nyou join me?' \n\nBond had a feeling that this might be the CI. A. man. \nHe knew he was right as they strolled off together \ntowards the bar, after Bond had thrown a plaque of ten \nmille to the croupier and had given a mille to the huissier \nwho drew back his chair. \n\n'My name's Felix Leiter,' said the American. 'Glad to \nmeet you. ' \n\n'Mine's Bond— James Bond.' \n\n\n\nROUGE ETNOIR 45 \n\n'Oh, yes,' said his companion, 'and now let's see. \nWhat shall we have to celebrate?' \n\nBond insisted on ordering Leiter's Haig-and Haig 'on \nthe rocks,' and then he looked carefully at the barman. \n\n'A dry Martini,' he said. 'One. In a deep champagne \ngoblet.' \n\n'Oui, Monsieur.' \n\n'Just a moment. Three measures of Gordon's, one of \nvodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well \nuntil it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon- \npeel. Got it?' \n\n'Certainly, monsieur.' The barman seemed pleased \nwith the idea. \n\n'Gosh, that's certainly a drink,' said Leiter. \n\nBond laughed. 'When I'm-er-concentrating,' he \nexplained, 'I never have more. than one drink before \ndinner. But I do like that one to be large and very strong \nand very cold and very well-made. I hate small portions \nof anything, particularly when they taste bad. This \ndrink's my own invention. I'm going to patent it when I \ncan think of a good name.' \n\nHe watched carefully as the deep glass became frosted \nwith the pale golden drink, slightly aerated by the \nbruising of the shaker. He reached for it and took a long \nsip. \n\n'Excellent,' he said to the barman, 'but if you can get \na vodka made with grain instead of potatoes, you will \nfind it still better.' \n\n'Mais n'enculons pas des mouches,' he added in an \naside to the barman. The barman grinned. \n\n'That's a vulgar way of saying \"we won't split \nhairs,\" ' explained Bond. \n\nBut Leiter was still interested in Bond's drink. 'You \ncertainly think things out,' he said with amusement as \nthey carried their glasses to a corner of the room. He \nlowered his voice: \n\n'You'd better call it the \"Molotov Cocktail\" after the \n\n\n\n46 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\none you tasted this afternoon.' , \n\nThey sat down. Bond laughed. \n- 'I see that the spot marked X has been roped off, and \nthey're making cars take a detour over the pavement. I \nhope it hasn't frightened away any of the big money. ' \n\n'People are accepting the communist story or else \nthey think it was a burst gas-main. All the burnt trees \nare coming down tonight and if they work things here \nlike they do at Monte Carlo, there won't be a trace of \nthe mess left in the morning.' \n\nLeiter shook a Chesterfield out of his pack. 'I'm glad \nto be working with you on this job,' he said, looking \ninto his drink, 'so I'm particularly glad you didn't get \nblown to glory. Our people are definitely interested. \nThey think it's just as important as your friends do, and \nthey don't think there's anything crazy about it at all. In \nfact, Washington's pretty sick we're not running the \nshow, but you know what the big brass is like. I expect \nyour fellows are much the same in London. ' \n\nBond nodded. 'Apt to be a bit jealous of their \nscoops,' he admitted. \n\n'Anyway, I'm under your orders and I'm to give you \nany help you ask for. With Mathis and his boys here, \nthere may not be much that isn't taken care of already. \nBut, anyway, here I am. ' \n\n'I'm delighted you are,' said Bond. 'The opposition \nhas got me, and probably you and Mathis too, all \nweighed up, and it seems no holds are going to be \nbarred. I'm glad Le Chiffre seems as desperate as we \nthought he was. I'm afraid I haven't got anything very \nspecific for you to do, but I'd be grateful if you'd stick \naround the Casino this evening. I've got an assistant, a \nMiss Lynd, and I'd like to hand her over to you when I \nstart playing. You won't be ashamed of her. She's a \ngood-looking girl.' He smiled at Leiter. 'And you might \nmark his two gunmen. I can't ; imagine he'll try a \nroughhouse, but you never know. ' \n\n\n\nROUGE ETNOIR \n\n\n\n47 \n\n\n\n'I may be able to help,' said Leiter. 'I was a regular in \nour Marine Corps before I joined this racket, if that \nmeans anything to you.' He looked at Bond with a hint \nof self-deprecation. \n. 'It does,' said Bond. \n\nIt turned out that Leiter was from Texas. While he \ntalked on about his job with the Joint Intelligence Staff \nof N.A.T.O. and the difficulty of maintaining security \nin an organization where so many nationalities were \nrepresented, Bond reflected th^t good Americans were \nfine people and that most of them seemed to come from \nTexas. \n\nFelix Leiter was about thirty-five. He was tall with a \nthin bony frame and his lightweight, tan-coloured suit \nhung loosely from his shoulders like the clothes of \nFrank Sinatra. His movements and speech were slow,\" \nbut one had the feeling that there was plenty of speed \nand strength in him, and that he. would be a tough-and \ncruel fighter. As he sat hunched over the table, he \nseemed to have some of the jackknife quality of a \nfalcon. There was this impression also in his face, in the \nsharpness of his chin and cheekbones and the wide wry \nmouth. His grey eyes had a feline slant which was in- \ncreased by his habit of screwing them up against the \nsmoke of the Chesterfields which he tapped out of the \npack in a chain. The permanent wrinkles which this \nhabit had etched at the corners gave the impression that \nhe smiled more with his eyes than with his mouth. A \nmop of straw-coloured hair lent his face a boyish look \nwhich closer examination contradicted. Although he \nseemed to talk quite openly about his duties in Paris, \nBond soon noticed that he never spoke of his American \ncolleagues in Europe or in Washington, and he guessed \nthat Leiter held the interests of his own organization far \nabove the mutual concerns of the North Atlantic Allies. \nBond sympathized with him. \n\nBy the time Leiter had swallowed another whisky and \n\n\n\n48 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nBond had told him about the Muntzes and his short \nreconnaissance trip down the coast that morning, it was \nseven-thirty, and they decided to stroll over to their \nhotel together. Before leaving the Casino, Bond \ndeposited his total capital of twenty-four million at the \ncaisse, keeping only a few notes of ten mille as pocket- \nmoney. \n\nAs they walked across to the Splendide, they saw that \na team of workmen was already busy at the scene of the \nexplosion. Several trees were uprooted and hoses frOm \nthree municipal tank cars were washing down the \nboulevard and pavements. The bomb-crater had disap- \npeared and only a few passers-by had paused to gape. \nBond assumed that similar face-lifting had already been \ncarried out at the Hermitage and to the, shops and front- \nages which had lost their windows. \" \n\nIn the warm blue dusk Royale-les-Eaux was once \nagain orderly and peaceful. \n\n'Who's the concierge working for?' asked Leiter as \nthey approached the hotel. Bond was not sure, and said \nso. \n\nMathis had been unable to enlighten him, 'Unless you \nhave bought him yourself,' he had said, 'you must \nassume that he has been bought by the other side. All \nconcierges are venal. It is not their fault. They are \ntrained to regard all hotel guests except maharajahs as \npotential cheats and thieves. They have as much concern \nfor your comfort or welKbeing as crocodiles.' \n\nBond remembered Mathis' s pronouncement when the \nconcierge hurried up to inquire whether he had \nrecovered from his most unfortunate experience of the \nafternoon. Bond thought it well to say that he still felt a \nlittle bit shaky. He hoped that if the intelligence were \nrelayed; Le Chiffre would at any rate start playing that \nevening with a basic misinterpretation of his adversary's \nstrength. The concierge proffered glycerine hopes for \nBond's recovery. \n\n\n\nROUGE ET NOIR 49 \n\nLetter's room was on one of the upper floors and they \nparted company at the lift after arranging to see each \nother at the Casino at around half-past ten or eleven, \nthe usual hour for the high tables to begin play. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8 \n\nPink Lights and Champagne \n\n\n\nBond walked up to his room, which again \nshowed no sign of trespass, threw off his clothes, took a \nlong hot bath followed by an ice-cold shower, and lay \ndown on his bed. There remained an hour in which to \nrest and compose his thoughts before he met the girl in \nthe Splendide bar, an hour to examine minutely the \ndetails of his plans for the game, and for after the game, \nin all the various circumstances of victory or defeat. He \nhad to plan the attendant roles of Mathis, Letter, and \nthe girl and visualize the reactions of the enemy in \nvarious contingencies. He closed his eyes, and his \nthoughts pursued his imagination through a series of \ncarefully constructed scenes as if he were watching the \ntumbling chips of coloured glass in a kaleidoscope. \n- At twenty minutes to nine he had exhausted all the \npermutations which might result from his duel with Le \nChiffre. He rose and dressed, dismissing the future \ncompletely from his mind. \nAs he tied his thin, double-ended, black satin tie, he \n\n\n\n50. \n\n\n\nPINK LIGHTS AND CHAMPAGNE \n\n\n\n51 \n\n\n\npaused for a moment and examined himself levelly in \nthe mirror. His grey-blue eyes looked calmly back with a \nhint of ironical inquiry and the short lock of black hair \nwhich would never stay in place slowly subsided to form \na thick comma above his right eyebrow. With the thin \nvertical scar down his right cheek the general effect was \nfaintly piratical. Not much of Hoagy Carmichael there, \nthought Bond, as he filled a flat, light, gun-metal box \nwith fifty of the Morland cigarettes with the triple gold \nband. Mathis had told him of the girl's comment. \n\nHe slipped the case into his hip pocket and snapped \nhis black oxidized Ronson to see if it needed fuel. After \npocketing the thin sheaf of ten-mille notes, he opened a \ndrawer and took out a light chamois leather holster and \nslipped it over his left shoulder so that it hung about \nthree inches below his armpit. He then took from under \nhis shirts in another drawer a very flat .25 Beretta \nautomatic With a skeleton grip, extracted the clip and \nthe single round in the barrel and whipped the action to \nand fro several times, finally pulling the trigger on the \nempty chamber. He charged the weapon again, loaded \nit, put up the safety catch, and dropped it into the \nshallow pouch of the shoulder-holster. He looked \ncarefully round the room to see if anything had been \nforgotten and slipped his single-breasted dinner-jacket \ncoat over his heavy silk evening shirt. He felt cool and \ncomfortable. He verified in the mirror that there was \nabsolutely no sign of the flat gun under his left arm, \ngave a final pull at his narrow tie and walked out of the \ndoor and locked it. \n\nWhen he turned at the foot of the short stairs towards \nthe bar, he heard the lift-door open behind him and a \ncool voice call, 'Good evening.'- \n\nIt was the girl. She stood and waited for him to come \nup to her. \n\nHe had remembered her beauty exactly. He was not \nsurprised to be thrilled by it again. \nHer dress, was of black velvet, simple and yet with the \n\n\n\n52 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\ntouch of splendour that only half a dozen couturiers in \nthe world can achieve. There was a thin necklace of \ndiamonds at her throat and a diamond clip in the low \nvee which just exposed the jutting swell of her breasts. \nShe carried a plain black evening bag, a flat oblong \nwhich she now held, her arm akimbo, at her waist. Her \njet-black hair hung straight and simply to the final in- \nward curl below the chin. \n\nShe looked quite superb, and Bond's heart lifted. \n\n'You look absolutely lovely. Business must be good in \nthe radio world!' \n\nShe put her arm through his. 'Do you mind if we go \nstraight in to dinner?' she asked. 'I want to make a \ngrand entrance, and the truth is there's a horrible secret \nabout black velvet. It marks when you sit down. And, \nby the way, if you hear me scream tonight, I shall have \nsat on a cane chair.' \n\nBond laughed. 'Of course, let's go straight in. We'll \nhave a glass of vodka while we order our dinner. ' \n\nShe gave him an amused glance, and he corrected \nhimself: 'Or a cocktail, of course, if you prefer it. The \nfood here's the best in Royale.' \n\nFor an instant he felt nettled at the touch of irony, the \nlightest shadow of a snub, with which she had met his \ndecisiveness, and at the way he had risen to her quick \nglance. \n\nBut it was only an infinitesimal clink of foils and as \nthe bowing maitre d'hStel led them through the crowded \nroom, it was forgotten as Bond in her wake watched the \nheads of the diners turn to look at her. \n\nThe fashionable part of the restaurant was beside the \nwide crescent of window built out like the broad stern of \na ship over the hotel gardens, but Bond had chosen a \ntable in one of the mirrored alcoves at the back of the \ngreat room. These had survived from Edwardian days \nand they were secluded and gay in white and gilt, with \nthe red silk-shaded table and wall lights of the late \nEmpire. \n\n\n\nPINK LIGHTS AND CHAMPAGNE \n\n\n\n53 \n\n\n\nAs they deciphered the maze of purple ink which \ncovered the double folio menu, Bond beckoned to the \nsommelier. He turned to his companion. \n\n'Have you decided?' \n\n'I would love a glass of vodka,' she said simply, and \nwent back to her study of the menu. \n\n'A small carafe of vodka, very cold,' ordered Bond. \nHe said to her abruptly: 'I can't drink the health of your \nnew frock without knowing your Christian name.' \n\n'Vesper, ' she said. 'Vesper Lynd. ' ,. \n\nBond gave her a look of inquiry. \n\n'It's rather abore always having to explain\/but I \/'was \nborn in the evening, on a very stormy evening according \nto my parents. Apparently they wanted to remember it.' \nShe smiled. 'Some people like it, others don't. I'm just \nused to it.' \n\n'I think it's a fine name,' said Bond. An idea struck \nhim. 'Can I borrow it? ? He explained about the special \nMartini he had invented and his search for a name for it. \n'The Vesper,' he said. 'It sounds perfect and it's very \nappropriate to the violet hour when my cocktail will \nnow be drunk all over the world. Can I have it? ' \n\n'So long as I can try one first*' she promised.. 'It \nsounds a drink to be proud of.' 1 \n\n'We'll have one together when all this is finished,' \nsaid Bond. 'Win or lose. And now have you decided \nwhat you would like to have for dinner? Please be ex- \npensive, ' he, added as he sensed her hesitation, 'or you'll \nlet down that beautiful frock.' .'-,■■•; \n\n'I'd made two choices,' she laughed, 'and either \nwould have been delicious; but behaving like a \nmillionaire occasionally is a wonderful treat, and if \nyou're sure . . . well, I'd like to start with caviar and \nthen have a\/plain grilled rognon de veau with pommes ' \nsoufflSs. And then I'd like to have fraises des bois with a \nlot of cream. Is it very shameless to be so certain and so \nexpensive? ' She smiled at him inquiringly. \n\n'It's a virtue, and anyway' it's only a good plain \n\n\n\n54 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nwholesome meal.' He turned to the maitre d'hdtel. 'And \nbring plenty of toast. \n\n'The trouble always is,' he explained to Vesper, 'not \nhow to get enough caviar, but how to get enough toast \nwith it. \n\n'Now,' he turned back to the menu, 'I myself will \naccompany Mademoiselle with the caviar; but then I \nwould like a very small tournedos, underdone, with \nsauce Bearnaise artd a coeur d'artichaut. While \nMademoiselle is enjoying the strawberries, I will have an \navocado pear with a little French dressing. Do you ap- \nprove?' \n\nThe maitred'hdtel bowed. \n\n'My compliments, mademoiselle and monsieur. Mon- \nsieur George . . .' He turned to the sommelier and \nrepeated the two dinners for his benefit . \n\n'Parfait,' said the sommelier, proffering the leather- \nbound wine list. \n\n'If you agree,' said Bond, 'I would prefer to drink \nchampagne with you tonight. It is a cheerful wine, and it \nsuits the occasion — I hope,' he added. \n\n'Yes, I would like champagne, ' she said. \n\nWith his finger on the page, Bond turned to the \nsommelier: 'The Taittinger 45?' \n\n'A fine wine, monsieur,' said the sommelier. 'But if \nMonsieur will permit,' he pointed with his pencil, 'the \nBrut Blanc de Blanc 1943 of the same marque is without \nequal.' - \n\nBond smiled. 'So be it,' he said. \n\n\"That is not a well-known brand,' Bond explained to \nhis companion, 'but it is probably the finest champagne \nin the world.' He grinned suddenly at the touch of \npretension in his remark. \n\n'You must forgive me,' he said. 'I take a ridiculous \npleasure in what I eat and drink. It comes partly from \nbeing a bachelor, but mostly from a habit of taking a lot \nof trouble over details. It's very pernickety and old- \nmaidish really, but then when I'm working I generally \n\n\n\nPINK LIGHTS AND CHAMPAGNE 55 \n\nhave to eat my meals alone and it makes them more in T \nteresting when one takes trouble.' ■ \nVesper smiled at him. \n\n'I like it,' she said. 'I like doing everything fully, get- \nting the most out of everything one does. I think that's \nthe way to live. But it sounds rather schoolgirlish when \none says it, 5 she added apologetically. \n\nThe little carafe of Vodka had arrived in its bowl of \ncrushed ice, and Bond filled their glasses. \n\n'Well, I agree with you anyway,' he said, 'and now, \nhere's luck for tonight, Vesper.' , , \n\n'Yes,' said the girl quietly, as she held up her small, \nglass and looked at him with a curious directness \nstraight in the'eyes. 'I hope all will go well tonight. - \n\nShe seemed to Bond to give a quick involuntary shrug \nof the shoulders as she spoke, but then she leant im- \npulsively towards him. : \n\n'I have some news for you from Mathis. He was \nlonging to tell you himself. It's, about the bomb: It's a \nfantastic story.' \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9 \n\nThe Game is Baccarat \n\n\n\nBond looked round; but there was no possibility \nof being overheard, and the cayiar would be waiting for \nthe hot toast from the kitchens. \n\n'Tell me. ' His eyes glittered with interest. \n\n'They got the third Bulgar, on the road to Paris. He \nwas in a Citroen, and he had picked up two English \nhikers as protective colouring. At the roadblock his \nFrench was so bad that they asked for his papers, and he \nbrought out a gun and shot one of the motor-cycle \npatrol. But the other man got him, I don't know how, \nand managed to stop him committing suicide. Then they \ntook him down to Rouen and extracted the story — in the \nusual French fashion, I suppose. \n\n'Apparently they were part of a pool held in France \nfor this sort of job — saboteurs, thugs, and so on — and \nMathis's friends are already trying to round up the rest. \nThey were to get two million francs for killing you, and \nthe agent who briefed them told them there was ab- \n\n\n\n56 \n\n\n\nTHE GAME IS BACCARAT \n\n\n\n57 \n\n\n\nsolutely no chance of being caught if they followed his \ninstructions exactly.' \n\nShe took a sip of vodka. 'But this is the interesting \npart. \n\n'The agent gave them the two camera-cases you saw. \nHe said the bright colours would make it easier for \nthem. He told them that the blue case contained a very \npowerful smoke-bomb. The red case was the explosive. \nAs one of them threw the red case the other was to press \na switch on the blue case, and they would escape under \ncover of the smoke. In fact, the smoke-bomb was a pure \ninvention to make the Bulgars think they could get \naway. Both cases contained an identical high-explosive \nbomb. There was no difference between the blue and the \nred cases. The idea was to destroy you and the bomb- \nthrowers without a trace. Presumably there were other \nplans for dealing with the third man. ' \n\n'Go on,' said Bond, full of admiration for the \ningenuity of the double-cross. \n\n'Well, apparently the Bulgars thought this sounded \nvery fine, but cannily they decided to take no chances. It \nwould be better, they thought, to touch off the smoke- \nbomb first and, from inside the cloud of smoke, hurl the \nexplosive bomb at you. What you saw was the assistant \nbomb-thrower pressing down the lever on the phony \nsmoke-bomb; and, of course, they both went up \ntogether. \n\n'The third Bulgar was waiting behind the Splendide to \npick his two friends up. When he saw what had hapr \npened, he assumed they had bungled. But the police \npicked up some fragments of the unexploded red bomb, \nand he was confronted with them. When he saw that \nthey had been tricked and that his two friends were \nmeant to be murdered with you, he started to talk. I ex- \npect he's still talking now. But there's nothing to link all \nthis with Le Chiffre. They were given the job by some \nintermediary, perhaps one of Le Chiffre's guards, and \n\n\n\n58 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nLe Chiffre's name means absolutely nothing to the one \nwho survived.' \n\nShe finished her story just as the waiters arrived with \nthe caviarj a mound of hot toast, and small dishes con- \ntaining finely chopped onion and grated hard-boiled \negg, the white in one dish and the yolk in another. \n\nThe caviar was heaped on to their plates, and they ate \nfor a time in silence. \n\nAfter a while Bond said: 'It's very satisfactory to be a \ncorpse who changes places with his murderers. For them, \nit certainly was a case of being hoist with their own \npetard. Mathis must be very pleased with the day's \nwork — five of the opposition neutralized in twe \n--864b51da73f2445f9dfd3bdc10f6f862-- \n",
