There I shall take up a useful and \nprofitable career and live to a' ripe and peaceful old age \nin the bosom of the family I shall doubtless create. So \nyou see, my dear boy, that I stand to lose nothing. If \nyou hand the money over, so much the better. If not, I \nshall shrug my shoulders and be on my way. ' \n\nHe paused, and his wrist lifted slightly on his knee. \nBond's flesh cringed as the cane surface just touched \nhim. \n\n'But you, my dear fellow, can only hope that I shall \nspare you further pain and spare your life. There is no \nother hope for you but that. Absolutely none. \n\n'Well?' \n\nBond closed his eyes and waited for the pain. He \n\n\n\n'MY DEAR BOY' \n\n\n\n115 \n\n\n\nknew that the beginning of torture is the worst. There is \na parabola of agony. A crescendo leading up to a peak, \nand then the nerves are blunted and react progressively \nless until unconsciousness and death. All he could do \nwas to pray for the peak, pray that his spirit would hold \nout so long and then accept the long free-wheel down to \nthe final blackout. \n\nHe had been told by colleagues who had survived tor- \nture by the Germans and the Japanese that towards the \nend there came a wonderful period of warmth and \nlanguor leading into a sort of sexual twilight where pain \nturned to pleasure and where hatred and fear of the tor- \ntures turned to a masochistic infatuation. It was the \n. supreme test of will, he had learnt, to avoid showing this \nform of punch-drunkenness. Directly it was suspected \nthey would either kill you at once and save themselves \nN further useless effort, or let you recover sufficiently for \nyour nerves to creep back to the other side of the \nparabola. Then they would start again. \n\nHe opened his eyes a fraction. \n\nLe Chiffre had been waiting for this, and like a rattle- \nsnake the cane instrument leapt up from the floor. It \nstruck again and again so that Bond screamed and his \nbody jangled in the chair like a marionette. \n\nLe Chiffre desisted only when Bond's tortured \nspasms showed a trace of sluggishness. He sat for a \nwhile sipping his coffee and frowning slightly like a \nsurgeon watching a cardiograph during a difficult \noperation. \n\nWhen Bond's eyes flickered and opened he addressed \nhim again, but now with a trace of impatience. \n\n'We know that the money is somewhere in your \nroom,' he said. 'You drew a cheque to cash for forty \n,\/ million francs, and I know that you went back to the \nhotel to hide it.' \n\nFor a moment Bond wondered how he had been so \ncertain. \n\n'Directly you left for the night club,' continued Le \n\n\n\n116 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nChiffre, 'your room was searched by four of my \npeople.' \n\nThe Muntzes must have helped, reflected Bond. \n\n'We found a good deal in childish hiding-places. The \nball-cock in the lavatory yielded an interesting little \ncode-book, -and we found some more of your papers \ntaped to the back of a drawer. All the furniture has been \ntaken to pieces, and your clothes and the curtains and \nbedclothes have been cut up. Every inch of the room has \nbeen searched, and all the fittings removed. It is most \nunfortunate for you that we didn't find the cheque. If \nwe had, you would now be comfortably in bed, perhaps \nwith the beautiful Miss Lynd, instead of this.' He lashed \nupwards. \n\nThrough the red mist of pain, Bond thought of \nVesper. He could imagine how she was being used by \nthe two gunmen. They would be making the most of her \nbefore she was sent for by Le Chiffre. He thought of the \nfat wet lips of the Corsican and the slow cruelty of the \nthin man. Poor wretch to have been dragged into this. \nPoor little beast. \n\nLe Chiffre was talking again. \n\n'Torture is a terrible thing,' he was saying as he \npuffed at a fresh cigarette, 'but it is a simple matter for \nthe torturer, particularly when the patient' — he smiled \nat the word — 'is a man. You see, my dear Bond, with a \nman it is quite unnecessary to indulge in refinements. \nWith this simple instrument, or with almost any other \nobject, one can cause a man as much pain as is possible \nor necessary. Do not believe what you read in novels or \nbooks about the war. There is nothing worse. It is not \nonly the immediate agony, but also the thought that \nyour manhood is being gradually destroyed and that at \nthe end, if you will not yield, you will no longer be a \nman. \n\n'That, my dear Bond, is a sad and terrible thought — a \nlong chain of agony for the body and also for the mind, \nand then the final screaming moment when you will beg \n\n\n\n'MY DEAR BOY' 117 \n\nme to kill you. All that is inevitable unless you tell me \nwhere you hid the money. ' \n\nHe poured some more coffee into the glass and drank \nit down, leaving brown corners to his mouth. \n\nBond's lips were writhing. He was trying to say \nsomething. At last he got the word out in a harsh croak: \n'Drink,' he said and his tongue came out and swilled \nacross his dry lips. . \n\n'Of course, my dear boy, how thoughtless of me!' Le \nChiffre poured some coffee into the other glass. There \nwas a ring of sweat drops on the floor all around Bond's \nchair. v \n\n'We must certainly keep your tongue lubricated.' \n\nHe laid the handle of the carpet-beater down on the \nfloor between his thick legs and rose from his chair. He \nwent behind Bond and taking a handful of his soaking \nhair in one hand, he wrenched Bond's, head sharply \nback. He poured the coffee down Bond's throat in small \nmouthfuls so that he would not choke. Then he released \nhis head so that it fell forward again on his chest. He \nwent back to his chair and picked up the carpet-beater. \n\nBond raised his head and spoke thickly. \n\n'Money no good to you.' His voice was a laborious \ncroak. 'Police trace it to you.' \n\nExhausted by the effort, his head sank forward again. \nHe was a little, but only a little, exaggerating the extent \nof his physical collapse. Anything to gain time, aind \nanything to defer the next searing pain. \n\n'Ah, my dear fellow, I had forgotten to tell you.' Le \nChiffre smiled wolfishly. 'We met after our little game \nat the Casino, and you were such a sportsman that you \nagreed we would have one more run through the pack \nbetween the two of us. It was a gallant gesture. Typical \nof an English gentleman. \n\n'Unfortunately you lost, and this upset you so much \nthat you decided to leave Royale immediately for an \nunknown destination. Like the gentleman you are, you \nvery kindly gave me a note explaining the circumstances \n\n\n\n118 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nso that I would have no difficulty in cashing your \ncheque. You see, dear boy, everything has been thought \nof, and you need have no fears on my account.' He \nchuckled fatly. \n\n'Now shall we continue? I have all the time in the \nworld, and truth to tell I am rather interested to see how \nlong a man can stand this particular form of — er — en- \ncouragement.' He rattled the harsh cane on the floor. \n\nSo that was the score, thought Bond, with a final \nsinking of the heart. The 'unknown destination' would \nbe under the ground or under the sea, or perhaps, more \nsimple, under the crashed Bentley. Well, if he had to die \nanyway, he might as well try it the hard way. He had no \nhope that Mathis or Leiter would get to him in time, but \nat least there was a chance that they would catch up with \nLe Chiffre before he could get away. It must be getting \non for seven. The car might have been found by now. It \nwas a choice of evils; but the longer Le Chiffre con- \ntinued the torture the more likely he would be revenged. \n\nBond lifted his head and looked Le Chiffre in the \neyes. \n\nThe china of the whites was now veined with red. It \nwas like looking at two black currants poached in \nblood. The rest of the wide face was yellowish except \nwhere a thick black stubble covered the moist skin. The \nupward edges of black coffee at the corners of the \nmouth gave his expression a false smile and the whole \nface was faintly striped by the light through the Venetian \nblinds. ', \n\n'No,' he said flatly, '. . . you.' \n\nLe Chiffre grunted and set to work again with savage \nfury. Occasionally he snarled like a wild beast. \nAfter ten minutes Bond had fainted, blessedly, \nLe Chiffre at once stopped. He wiped some sweat \nfrom his face with a circular motion of his disengaged \nhand. Then he looked at his watch and seemed to make \nup his mind. • \n\nHe got up and stood behind the inert, dripping body. \n\n\n\n'MY DEAR BOY* \n\n\n\n119 \n\n\n\nThere was no colour in Bond's face or anywhere on his \nbody above the waist. There was a faint flutter of his \nskin above the heart. Otherwise he might have been \ndead. \n\nLe Chiffre seized Bond's ears and harshly twisted \nthem. Then he leant forward and slapped his cheeks \nhard several times. Bond's head rolled from side to side \nwith each blow. Slowly his breathing became deeper. An \nanimal groan came from his lolling mouth. , \n\nLe Chiffre took a glass of coffee and poured some \ninto Bond's mouth and threw the rest in his face. Bond's \neyes slowly opened. \n\nLe Chiffre returned to his chair and waited. He lit a \ncigarette and contemplated the spattered pool of blood \non the floor beneath the inert body opposite. \n\nBond groaned again pitifully. It was an inhuman \nsound. His eyes opened wide, and he gazed dully at his \ntorturer. . .„ \n\nLe Chiffre spoke. \n\n'That is all, Bond. We will now finish with you. You \nunderstand? Not kill you, but finish with you. And then \nwe will have in the girl and see if something can be got \nout of the remains of the two of you.' . \n\nHe reached towards the table. \n\n'Say goodbye to it, Bond.' \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18 \n\nA Craglike Face \n\n\n\nIt was extraordinary to hear the third voice. The \nhour's ritual had only demanded a duologue against the \nhorrible noise of the torture. Bond's dimmed senses \nhardly took it in. Then suddenly he was halfway back to \nconsciousness. He found he could see and hear again. \nHe could hear the dead silence after the one quiet word \nfrom the doorway. He could see Le Chiffre's head \nslowly come up and the expression of blank astonish- \nment, of innocent amazement, slowly give way to fear. \n\n'Shtop,' had said the voice, quietly. \n\nBond heard slow steps approaching behind his chair. \n\n'Dhrop it,' said the voice. \n\nBond saw Le Chiffre's hand open obediently and the \nknife fall with a clatter to the floor. \n\nHe tried desperately to read into Le Chiffre's face \nwhat was happening behind him, but all he saw was \nblind incomprehension and terror. Le Chiffre's mouth \nworked, but only a high-pitched 'eek' came from it. His \nheavy cheeks trembled as he tried to collect enough \n\n\n\n120 \n\n\n\nA CRAGLIKE FACE \n\n\n\n121 \n\n\n\nsaliva in his mouth to say something, ask something. \nHis hands fluttered vaguely in his lap. One of them \nmade a slight movement towards his pocket, but in- \nstantly fell back. His round staring eyes had lowered for \na split second, and Bond guessed there was a gun trained \non him. \n\nThere was a moment's silence. \n\n'Smersh.' \n\nThe word came almost with a sigh. It came with a \ndownward cadence as if nothing else had to be said. It \nwas the final explanation. The last word of all. \n\n'No,' said Le Chiffre. 'No. I . . .' His voice trailed \noff. \n\nPerhaps he was going to explain, to apologize, but \nwhat he must have seen in the other's face made it all \nuseless. \n\n'Your two men. Both dead. You are a fool and a thief \nand a traitor. I have been sent from the Soviet Union to \neliminate you. You are fortunate that I have only time \nto shoot you. If it was possible, I was instructed that \nyou should die most painfully. We cannot see the end of \nthe trouble you have caused.' \n\nThe thick voice stopped. There was silence in the \nroom save for the rasping breath of Le Chiffre. \n\nSomewhere outside, a bird began to sing and there \nwere other small noises from the awakening coun- \ntryside. The sweat on Le Chiffre's face glistened \nbrightly. \n\n'Do you plead guilty? ' \n\nBond wrestled with his consciousness. He screwed up \nhis eyes and tried to shake his head to clear it; but his \nwhole nervous system was numbed, and no message \nwas transmitted to his muscles. He could just keep his \nfocus on the great pale face in front of him and on its \nbulging eyes. \n\nA thin string of saliva crept from the open mouth and \nhung down from the chin. \n\n'Yes,' said the mouth. . . . \n\n\n\n122 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nThere was a sharp phut, no louder than a bubble of \nair escaping from a tube of toothpaste. No other noise \nat all, and suddenly Le Chiffre had grown another eye, \na third eye on a level with the other two, right where the \nthick nose started to jut out below the forehead. It was a \nsmall black eye, without eyelashes or eyebrows. \n\nFor a second the three eyes looked out across the \nroom, and then the whole face seemed to slip and go \ndown on one knee. The two outer eyes turned trembling \nup towards the ceiling. Then the heavy head fell \nsideways and the right shoulder and finally the whole \nupper part of the body lurched over the arm of the chair \nas if Le Chiffre were going to be sick. But there was only \na short rattle of his heels on the ground, and then no \nother movement. \n\nThe tall back of the chair looked impassively out \nacross the dead body in its arms. \n\nThere was a faint movement behind Bond. A hand \ncame from behind and grasped his chin and pulled it \nback. \n\nFor a moment Bond looked up into two glittering eyes \nbehind a narrow black mask. There was the impression \nof a craglike face under a hatbrim, the collar of a fawn \nmackintosh. He could take in nothing more before his \nhead was pushed down again. \n\n'You are fortunate,' said the voice. 'I have no orders \nto kill you. Your life has been saved twice in one day. \nBut you can tell your organization that SMERSH is only \nmerciful by chance or by mistake. In your case you were \nsaved first by chance and now by mistake, for I should \nhave had orders to kill any foreign spies who were \nhanging around this traitor like flies round a dog's- \nmess. \n\n'But I shall leave you my visiting card. You are a gam- \nbler. You play at cards. One day perhaps you will play \nagainst one of us. It would be well that you should be \nknown as a spy.' \n\nSteps moved round to behind Bond's right shoulder. \n\n\n\nA CRAG LIKE FACE \n\n\n\n123 \n\n\n\nThere was the click of a knife opening. An arm in some \ngrey material came into Bond's line of vision. A broad \nhairy hand emerging from a dirty white shirt-cuff was \nholding a thin stiletto like a fountain-pen. It poised for a \nmoment above the back of Bond's right hand, im- \nmovably bound with flex to the arm of the chair. The \npoint of the stiletto executed three quick straight \nslashes. A fourth slash crossed them where they ended, \njust short of the knuckles. Blood in the shape of an in- \nverted 'M' welled out and slowly started to drip on to \nthe floor. \n\nThe pain was nothing to what Bond was already suf- \nfering, but it was enough to plunge him again into un- \nconsciousness. \n\nThe steps moved quietly away across the room. The \ndoor was softly closed. \n\nIn the silence, the cheerful small sounds of the sum- \nmer's day crept through the closed window. High on the \nleft-hand wall hung two small patches of pink light. They \nwere reflections cast upwards from the floor by the \nzebra stripes of June sunshine, cast upwards from two \nseparate pools of blood a few feet apart. \n\nAs the day progressed the pink patches marched \nslowly along the wall. And slowly they grew larger. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19 \n\nThe White Tent \n\n\n\nYou are about to awaken when you dream that \nyou are dreaming. \n\nDuring the next two days James Bond was per- \nmanently in this state without regaining consciousness. \nHe watched the procession of his dreams go by without \nmaking any effort to disturb their sequence, although \nmany of them were terrifying and all were painful. He \nknew that he was in a bed and that he was lying on his \nback and could not move and in one of his twilight \nmoments he thought there were people round him; but \nhe made no effort to open his eyes and reenter the \nworld. \n\nHe felt safe in the darkness, and he hugged it to him. \n\nOn the morning of the third day a bloody nightmare \nshook him awake, trembling and sweating. There was a \nhand on his forehead which he associated with his \ndream. He tried to lift an arm and smash it sideways \ninto the owner of the hand, but his arms were im- \nmovable, secured to the sides of his bed. His whole body \n\n\n\n124 \n\n\n\nTHEWHITETENT \n\n\n\n125 \n\n\n\nwas strapped down and something like a large white cof- \nfin covered him from chest to feet and obscured his view \nof the end of the bed. He shouted a string of obscenities; \nbut the effort took all his strength, and the words tailed \noff into a sob. Tears of forlornness and self-pity welled \nout of his eyes. \n\nA woman's voice was speaking, and the words \ngradually penetrated to him. It seemed to be a kind \nvoice, and it slowly came to him that he was being com- \nforted, and that this was a friend and not an enemy. He \ncould hardly believe it. He had been so certain that he \nwas still a captive, and that the torture was about to \nbegin again. He felt his face being softly wiped with a \ncool cloth which smelt of lavender, and then he sank \nback into his dreams. \n\nWhen he awoke again some hours later all his terrors \nhad gone, and he felt warm and languorous. Sun was \nstreaming into the bright room, and garden sounds \ncame through the window. In the background there was \nthe noise of small waves on a beach. As he moved his \nhead he heard a rustle, and a nurse who had been sitting \nbeside his pillow rose and came into his line of vision. \nShe was pretty, and she smiled as she put her hand on \nhis pulse. \n\n'Well, I'm certainly glad you've woken up at last. I've \nnever heard such dreadful language in my life. ' \nBond smiled back at her. \n\n'Where am I?' he asked, and was surprised that his \nVoice sounded firm and clear. \n\n'You're in a nursing home at Royale and I've been \nsent over from England to look after you. There are two \nof us, and I'm Nurse Gibson. Now just lie quiet, and I'll \ngo and tell doctor you're awake. You've been un- \nconscious since they brought you in, and we've been \nquite worried.' \n\nBond closed his eyes and mentally explored his body. \nThe worst pain was in his wrists and ankles and in his \nright hand where the Russian had cut him. In the centre \n\n\n\n126 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nof the body there was no feeling. He assumed that he \nhad been given a local anaesthetic. The rest of his body \nached dully as if he had been beaten all over. He could \nfeel the pressure of bandages everywhere, and his un- \nshaven neck and chin prickled against the sheets. From \nthe feel of the bristles he knew that he must have been at \nleast three days without shaving. That meant two days \nsince the morning of the torture. \n\n- He was preparing a short list of questions in his mind \nwhen the door opened and the doctor came in followed \nby the nurse and, in the background, the dear figure of \nMathis, a Mathis looking anxious behind his broad \nsmile, who put a finger to his lips and walked on, tiptoe \nto the window and sat down. \n\nThe doctor, a Frenchman with a young and intelligent \nface, had been detached from his duties with the \nDeuxiSme Bureau to look after Bond's case. He came \nand stood beside Bond and put his hand on Bond's \nforehead while he looked at the temperature chart \nbehind the bed. \n\nWhen he spoke he was forthright. \n\n'You have a lot of questions to ask, my dear Mr. \nBond,' he said in excellent English, 'and I can tell you \nmost of the answers. I do not want you to waste your \nstrength, so I will give you the salient facts and then you \nmay have a few minutes with Monsieur Mathis who \nwishes to obtain one or two details from you. It is really \ntoo early for this talk, but I wish to set your mind at rest \nso that we can proceed with the task of repairing your \nbody without bothering too much about your mind.' \n\nNurse Gibson pulled up a chair for the doctor and left \nthe room. \n\n'You have been here about two days,' continued the \ndoctor. 'Your car was found by a farmer on the way to \nmarket in Royale, and he informed the police. After \nsome delay Monsieur Mathis heard that it was your car, \nand he immediately went to Les Noctambules with his \nmen. You and Le Chiffre were found and also your \n\n\n\nTHE WHITE TENT 127 \n\nfriend, Miss Lynd, who was unharmed and according to \nher account suffered no molestation. She was prostrated \nwith shock, but is now fully recovered and is at her \nhotel. She has been instructed by her superior in \nLondon to stay at Royale under your orders until you \nare sufficiently recovered to go back to England. \n\n'Le Chiffre's two gunmen are dead, each killed by a \nsingle .35 bullet in the back of the skull. From the lack \nof expression on their faces, they evidently never saw or \nheard their assailant. They were found in the same room \nas Miss Lynd. Le Chiffre is dead, shot with a similar \nweapon between the eyes. Did you witness his death? ' \n\n'Yes,' said Bond. \n\n'Your own injuries are serious, but your life is not in \ndanger though you have lost a lot of blood. If all goes \nwell, you will recover completely and none of the func- \ntions of your body will be impaired.' The doctor smiled \ngrimly. 'But I fear that you will continue to be in pain \nfor several days, and it will be my endeavour to give you \nas much comfort as possible. Now that you have \nregained consciousness your arms will be freed, but you \nmust not move your body; and when you sleep the nurse \nhas orders to secure your arms again. Above all, it is im- \nportant that you rest and regain your strength. At the \nmoment you are suffering from a grave condition of \nmental and physical, shock.' The doctor paused. 'For \nhow long Were you maltreated? ' \n\n'About an hour, ' said Bond. \n\n'Then it is remarkable that you are alive, and I \ncongratulate you. Few men could have supported what \nyou have been through. Perhaps that is some con- \nsolation. As Monsieur Mathis can tell you, I have had in \nmy time to treat a number of patients who have suffered \nsimilar handling, and not one has come through it as \nyou have done.' \n\nThe doctor looked at Bond for a moment and turned \nbrusquely to Mathis. \n\n'You may have ten minutes, and then you will be \n\n\n\n128 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nforcibly ejected. If you put the patient's temperature \nup, you will answer for it.' \n\nHe gave them both a broad smile and left the room. \n\nMathis came over and took the doctor's chair. \n\n'That's agoodman,' said Bond. 'I like him.' \n\n'He's attached to the Bureau,' said Mathis. 'He is a \nvery good man, and I will tell you about him one of \nthese days. He thinks you are a prodigy — and so do I, \n\n'However, that can wait. As you can imagine, there is \nmuch to clear up, and I am being pestered by Paris and, \nof course, London, and even by Washington via our \ngood friend Leiter. Incidentally,' he broke off, 'I have a \npersonal message from M. He spoke to me himself on \nthe telephone. He simply said to tell you that he is much \nimpressed. I asked if that was all, and he said: \"Well, \ntell him that the Treasury is. greatly relieved.\" Then he \nrang off.' \n\nBond grinned with pleasure. What most warmed him \nwas that M. himself should have rung up Mathis.. This \nwas quite unheard of. The very existence of M., let \nalone his identity, was never admitted. He could \nimagine the flutter this must have caused in the ultra- \nsecurity-minded organization in London. \n\n'A tall thin man with one arm came over from \nLondon the same day we found you,' continued Mathis, \nknowing from his own experience that these shop details \nwould interest Bond more than anything else and give \nhim most pleasure, 'and he fixed up the nurses and \nlooked after everything. Even your car's being repaired \nfor you. He seemed to be Vesper's boss. He spent a lot \nof time with her and gave her strict instructions to look \nafter you.' \n\nHead of S., thought Bond. They're certainly giving \nme the red-carpet treatment. \n\n'Now,' said Mathis, 'to business. Who killed Le \nChiffre?' \n\n'SMERSH,' said Bond. \n\nMathis gave a low whistle. \n\n\n\nTHE WHITE TENT \n\n\n\n129 \n\n\n\n'My God,' he said respectfully. 'So they were on to \nhim. What did he look like?' ,: \n\nBond explained briefly what had happened up to the \nmoment of Le Chiffre's death, omitting all but the most \nessential details. It cost him an effort, and he was glad \nwhen it was done. Casting his mind back to the scene \nawoke the whole nightmare, and the sweat began to \npour off his forehead and a deep throb of pain started \nup in his body. \n\nMathis realized that he was going too far. Bond's \nvoice was getting feebler, and his eyes were clouding. \nMathis snapped shut his shorthand book and laid a \nhand on Bond's shoulder. \n\n'Forgive me, my friend,' he said. 'It is all over now, \nand you are in safe hands. All is well, and the whole \nplan has gone splendidly. We have announced that Le \nChiffre shot his two accomplices and then committed \nsuicide because he could, not face an inquiry into the \nunion funds. Strasbourg and the north are in an uproar. \nHe was considered a great hero there and a pillar of the \nCommunist Party in France. This story of brothels and \ncasinos has absolutely knocked the bottom out of his \norganization, and they're all running around like \nscalded cats. At the moment the Communist Party is \ngiving out that he was off his head. But that hasn't \nhelped much after Thorez's breakdown not long ago. \nThey're just making it look as if all their big-shots were \ngaga. God knows how they're going to unscramble the \nwhole business.' \n\nMathis saw that his enthusiasm had had the desired \neffect. Bond's eyes were brighter. \n\n'One last mystery,' Mathis said, 'and then I promise I \nwill go.' He looked at his watch. 'The doctor will be \nafter my skin in a moment. Now, what about the \nmoney? Where is it? Where did you hide it? We too \nhave been over your room with 1 a toothcomb. It isn't \nthere.' \n\nBond grinned. \n\n\n\n130 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\n'It is,' he said, 'more or less. On the door of each \nroom, there is a small square of black plastic with the \nnumber of the room on it. On the corridor side, of \ncourse. When Leiter left me that night, I simply opened \nthe door and unscrewed my number plate and put the \nfolded cheque underneath it and screwed the plate back. \nIt'll still be there.' He smiled. 'I'm glad there's \nsomething the stupid English can teach the clever \nFrench.' \n\nMathis laughed delightedly. \n\n'I suppose you think that's paid me back for knowing \nwhat the Muntzes were up to. Well, I'll call it quits. In- \ncidentally, we've got them in the bag. They were just \nsome minor fry hired for the occasion. We'll see that \nthey get a few years. ' \n\nHe rose hastily as the doctor stormed into the room \nand took one look at Bond. \n\n'Out,' he said to Mathis! 'Out, and don't come back.' \n\nMathis just had time to wave cheerfully to Bond and \ncall some hasty words of farewell before he was hustled \nthrough the door. Bond heard a torrent of heated \nFrench diminishing down the corridor. He lay back \nexhausted, but heartened by all he had heard. He found \nhimself thinking of Vesper as he quickly drifted off into \na troubled sleep. \n\nThere were still questions to be answered, but they \ncould wait. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20 •■ ' \n\nThe Nature of Evil \n\n\n\nBond made good progress. When Mathis came to \nsee him three days later he was propped up in bed, and \nhis arms were free. The lower half of his body was still \nshrouded in the oblong tent, but he looked cheerful and \nit was only occasionally that a twinge of pain narrowed \nhis eyes. \nMathis looked crestfallen. \n\n'Here's your cheque,' he said to Bond. 'I've rather \nenjoyed walking around with forty million francs in my \npocket, but I suppose you'd better sign it and I'll put it \nto your account with the Credit Lyonnais. There's no \nsign of our friend from SMERSH. Not a damn trace. He \nmust have got to the villa on foot or on a bicycle because \nyou heard nothing of his arrival and the two gunmen \nobviously didn't. It's pretty exasperating. We've got \nprecious little on this SMERSH organization, and neither \nhas London. Washington said they had; but it turned \nout to be the usual waffle from refugee interrogation, \nand you know that's about as much good as in- \n\n\n\n131 \n\n\n\n132 CASINO ROYALE \n\nterrogating an English man-in-the-street about his own \nSecret Service, or a Frenchman about the Deuxieme.' \n\n'He probably came from Leningrad to Berlin via j \n\"Warsaw, ' said Bond. 'From Berlin. they've got plenty of j \nroutes open to the rest of Europe. He's back home by \nnow being told off for not shooting me too. I fancy \nthey've got quite a file on me in view of one or two of i \nthe jobs M.'s given me since the war. He obviously I \nthought he was being smart enough cutting his initial in \nmy hand.' \n\n'What's that?' asked Mathis. 'The doctor said the \ncuts looked like a square M with a tail to the top. He \nsaid they didn't mean anything.' \n\n•'Well, I Only got a glimpse before I passed out, but \nI've seen the cuts several times while they were being \ndressed and I'm pretty certain they are the Russian letter \nfor SH. It's rather like an inverted M with a tail. That \nwould make sense. SMERSH is short for smyert \nSHPIONAM— Death to Spies— and he thinks he's labelled \nme as a SHPION. It's a nuisance because M. will \nprobably say I've got to go to hospital again when I get \nback to London and have new skin grafted over the \nwhole of the back of my hand. It doesn't matter much. \nI've decided to resign.' \n\nMathis looked at him with his mouth open. \n\n'Resign? ' he asked incredulously. 'What the hell for? ' \n\nBond looked away from Mathis. He studied his ban- \ndaged hands. \n\n'When I was being beaten up,' he said, 'I suddenly \nliked the idea of being alive. Before Le Chiffre began, \nhe used a phrase which stuck in my mind: \"playing Red \nIndians.\" He said that's what I had been doing. Well, I \nsuddenly thought he might be right. \n\n'You see,' he said, still looking down at his bandages, \n'when one's young, it seems very easy to distinguish be- \ntween right and wrong; but as one gets older it becomes \nmore difficult. At school it's easy to pick out one's own \n\n\n\nTHE NATURE OF EVIL \n\n\n\n133 \n\n\n\nvillains and heroes, and one grows up wanting to be a \nhero and kill the villains . ' \n\nHe looked obstinately at Mathis. \n\n'Well, in the last few years I've killed two villains. \nThe first was in New York — a Japanese cipher expert \ncracking our codes on the thirty-sixth floor of the \nR.C.A. Building in Rockefeller Center, where the Japs \nhad their consulate. I took a room on the fortieth floor \nof the next-door skyscraper, and I could look across the \nstreet into his room and see him working.. Then I got a \ncolleague from our organization in New York and a \ncouple of Remington thirty-thirty's with telescopic \nsights and silencers. We smuggled them up to my room \nand sat for days waiting for our chance. He shot at the \nman a second before me. His job was only to blast a \nhole through the window so that I could shoot the Jap \nthrough it. They have tough windows at Rockefeller \nCenter to keep the noise out. It worked very well. As I \nexpected, his bullet got deflected by the glass and went \nGod knows where. But I shot immediately after him, \nthrough the hole he had made. I got the Jap in the \nmouth as he turned to gape at the broken window.' \n\nBond smoked for a minute. \n\n'It was a pretty sound job. Nice and clean too. Three \nhundred yards away. No personal contact. The next \ntime in Stockholm wasn't so pretty. I had to kill a Nor- \nwegian who was doubling against us for the Germans. \nHe'd managed to get two of our men captured \n— probably bumped off for all I know. For various \nreasons it had to be an absolutely silent job. I chose the \nbedroom of his flat and a knife. And, well, he just \ndidn' t die very quickly. \n\n'For those two jobs I was awarded a Double O num- \nber in the Service. Felt pretty clever and got a reputation \nfor being good and tough. A Double O number in our \nService means you've had to kill a chap in cold blood in \nthe course of some job. \n\n\n\n134 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\n'Now,' he looked up again at Mathis, 'that's all very \nfine — the hero kills two villains; but when the hero \nLe Chiffre starts to kill the villain Bond and the villain \nBond knows he isn't a villain at all, you see the other \nside of the medal. The villains and heroes get all mixed \nup. \n\n'Of course,' he added, as Mathis started to ex- \npostulate, 'patriotism comes along and makes it seem \nfairly all right, but this country-right-or-wrong business \nis getting a little out of date. Today we are fighting com- \nmunism. Okay. If I'd been alive fifty years ago, the \nbrand of conservatism we have today would have been \ndamn near called communism, and we should have been \ntold to go and fight that. History is moving pretty \nquickly these days, and the heroes and villains keep on \nchanging parts.' \n\nMathis stared at him aghast. Then he tapped his head \nand put a calming hand on Bond's arm. \n\n'You mean to say that this precious Le Chiffre who \ndid his best to turn you into a eunuch doesn't qualify as \na villain?' he asked. 'Anyone would think from the rot \nyou talk that he had been battering your head instead of \nyour . . .' he gestured down the bed. 'You wait till M. \ntells you to get after another Le Chiffre. I bet you'll go \nafter him all right. And what about SMERSH? I can tell \nyou I don't like the idea of these chaps running around \nFrance killing anyone they feel has been a traitor to their \nprecious political system. You're a bloody anarchist.' \n\nHe threw his arms in the air and let them fall \nhelplessly to his sides. \n\nBond laughed. \n\n'All right,' he said. 'Take our friend Le Chiffre. It's \nsimple enough to say he was an evil man; at least it's \nsimple enough for me, because he did evil things to me. \nIf he was here now, I wouldn't hesitate to kill him^but \nout of personal revenge and not, I'm afraid, for some \nhigh moral reason or for the sake of my country.' \n\nHe looked up at Mathis to see how bored he was \n\n\n\nTHE NATURE OF EVIL \n\n\n\n135 \n\n\n\ngetting with these introspective refinements of what, to \nMathis, was a simple question of his duty. \nMathis smiled back at him. \n\n'Continue, my dear friend. It is interesting for me to \nsee this new Bond. Englishmen are so odd. They are like \na nest of Chinese boxes. It takes a very long time to get \nto the centre of them. When one gets there the result is \nunrewarding, but the process is instructive and en- \ntertaining. Continue. Develop your arguments. There \nmay be something I can use to my own chief the next \ntime I want to get out of an unpleasant job.' He grinned \nmaliciously. \n\nBond ignored him. \n\n'Now in order to tell the difference between good and \nevil, we have manufactured two images representing the \nextremes — representing the deepest black and the purest \nwhite— and we call them God and the Devil. But in \ndoing so we have cheated a bit. God is a clear image, \nyou can see every hair on His beard. But the Devil. \nWhat does he look like?' Bond looked triumphantly at \nMathis. '■ \n\nMathis laughed ironically. \n\n'A woman.' \n\n'It's all very fine,' said Bond; 'but I've been thinking \nabout these things, and I'm wondering whose side I \nought to be on. I'm getting very sorry for the Devil and \nMs disciples, such as the good Le Chiffre. The Devil has \na rotten time, and I always like to be on the side of the \nunderdog. We don't give the poor chap a chance. \nThere's a Good Book about goodness and how to be \ngood and so forth, but there's no Evil Book about evil \nand how to be bad. The Devil had no prophets to write \nhis Ten Commandments, and no team of authors to \nwrite his biography. His case has gone completely by \ndefault. We know nothing about him but a lot of fairy \n.. stories from our parents and schoolmasters. He has no \nbook from which we can learn the nature of evil in all its \nforms, with parables about evil people, proverbs about \n\n\n\n136 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nevil people, folklore about evil people. All we have is the \nliving example of the people who are least good, or our \nown intuition. \n\n'So,' continued Bond, warming to his argument, 'Le \nChiffre was serving a wonderful purpose, a really vital \npurpose, perhaps the best and highest purpose of all. By \nhis evil existence, which foolishly I have helped to \ndestroy, he was creating a norm of badness by which, \nand by which alone, an opposite norm of goodness \ncould exist. We were privileged, in our short knowledge \nof him, to see and estimate his wickedness, and we \nemerge from the acquaintanceship better and more vir- \ntuous men.' \n\n'Bravo,' said Mathis. 'I'm proud of you. You ought \nto be tortured every day. I really must remember to do \nsomething evil this evening. I must start at once. I have \na few marks in my favour — only small ones, alas,' he \nadded ruefully; 'but I shall work fast now that I have \nseen the light. What a splendid time I'm going to have! \nNow, let's see, where shall I start — murder, arson, \nrape? But no, these are peccadilloes. I must really con- \nsult the good Marquis de Sade. I am a child, an absolute \nchild in these matters.' \n\nHis face fell. \n\n'Ah, but our conscience, my dear Bond. What shall \nwe do with him while we are committing some juicy sin? \nThat is a problem. He is a crafty person this conscience \nand very old, as old as the first family of apes which \ngave birth to him. We must give that problem really \ncareful thought, or we shall spoil our enjoyment. Of \ncourse, we should murder him first, but he is a tough \nbird. It will be difficult, but if we succeed we could be \nworse even than Le Chiffre. \n\n'For you, dear James, it is easy. You can start off by \nresigning. That was a brilliant thought of yours, a splen- \ndid start to your new career. And so simple. Everyone \nhas the revolver of resignation in his pocket. All you've \ngot to do is pull the trigger, and you will have made a \n\n\n\nTHE NATURE OF EVIL \n\n\n\n137 \n\n\n\nbig hole in your country and your conscience at the \nsame time. A murder and a suicide with one bullet! \nSplendid. What a difficult and glorious profession! As \nfor me, I must start embracing the new cause at once.' \nHe looked at his watch. \n\n'Good. I've started already. I'm half an hour late for \na meeting with the chief of police. ' \nHe rose to his feet, laughing. \n\n'That was most enjoyable, my dear James. You really \nought to go on the halls. Now about that little problem \nof yours, this business of not knowing good men from \nbad men and villains from heroes, and so forth. It is, of \ncourse, a difficult problem in the abstract. The secret \nlies in personal experience, whether you're a Chinaman \nor an Englishman.' \n\nHe paused at the door. \n\n'You admit that Le Chiffre did you personal evil, and \nthat you would kill him if he appeared in front of you \nnow? \n\n'Well, when you get back to London you will find \nthere are other Le Chiffres seeking to destroy you and \nyour friends and your country. M. will tell you about \nthem. And now that you have seen a really evil man you \nwill know how evil they can be, and you will go after \nthem to destroy them in order to protect yourself and \nthe people you love. You won't wait or argue about it. \nYou know what they look like now and what they can \ndo to people. You may be a bit more choosy about the \njobs you fake on. You may want to be certain that the \ntarget really is black; but there are plenty of really black \ntargets around. There's still plenty for you to do. And \nyou'll do it. And when you fall in love and have a \nmistress or a wife and children to look after, it will seem \nall the easier.' \n\nMathis opened the door and stopped on the \nthreshold. \n\n'Surround yourself with human beings, my dear \nJames. They are easier to fight for than principles. ' \n\n\n\n138 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nHe laughed. 'But don't let me down and become \nhuman yourself. We would lose such a wonderful \nmachine.' \n\nWith a wave of the hand he shut the door. \n'Hey, ' shouted Bond. \n\nBut the footsteps went quickly off down the passage. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21 \n\n\n\nVesper \n\n\n\nIt was on the next day that Bond asked to see \nVesper. \n\nHe had not wanted to see her before. He was told that \nevery day she came to the nursing home and asked after \nhim. Flowers had arrived from her. Bond didn't like \nflowers, and he told the nurse to give them to another \npatient. After this had happened twice, no more flowers \ncame. Bond had not meant to offend her. He disliked \nhaving feminine things around him. Flowers seemed to \nask for recognition of the person who had sent them, to \nbe constantly transmitting a message of sympathy and \naffection. Bond found this irksome. He disliked being \ncosseted. It gave him claustrophobia. \n\nBond was bored at the idea of having to explain some \nof this to Vesper. And he was embarrassed at having to \nask one or two questions which mystified him, questions \nabout Vesper's behaviour. The answers would almost \ncertainly make her out to be a fool. Then he had his full \nreport to M. to think about. In this he didn't want to \n\n\n\n139 \n\n\n\n140 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nhave to criticize Vesper. It might easily cost her her job. \n\nBut above all, he admitted to himself, he shirked the \nanswer to a more painful question. \n\nThe doctor had talked often to Bond about his in- \njuries. He had always told him that there would be no \nevil effects from the terrible battering his body had \nreceived. He had said that Bond's full health would \nreturn, and that none of his powers had been taken \nfrom him. But the evidence of Bond's eyes and his \nnerves refused these comforting assurances. He was still \npainfully swollen and bruised, and whenever the in- \njections wore off he was in agony. Above all, his \nimagination had suffered. For an hour in that room \nwith Le Chiffre the certainty of impotence had been \nbeaten into him; and a scar had been left on his mind \nthat could only be healed by experience. \n\nFrom the day when Bond first met Vesper in the Her- \nmitage bar, he had found her desirable; and he knew \nthat if things had been different in the night club, if \nVesper had responded in any way and if there had been \nno kidnapping, he would have tried to sleep with her \nthat night. Even later, in the car and outside the villa \nwhen he had had other things to think about, his \neroticism had been hotly aroused by the sight of her in- \ndecent nakedness. \n\nAnd now, when he could see her again, he was afraid. \nAfraid that his senses and his body would not respond \nto her sensual beauty. Afraid that he would feel no stir \nof desire, and that his blood would stay cool. In his \nmind he had made this first meeting into a test, and he \nwas shirking the answer. That was the real reason, he \nadmitted, why he had waited to give his body a chance \nto respond, why he had put off . their first meeting for \nover a week. He would have liked to put off the meeting \nstill further, but he explained to himself that his report \nmust be written, that any day an emissary from London \nwould come over and want to hear the full story, that \n\n\n\nVESPER \n\n\n\n141 \n\n\n\ntoday was as good as tomorrow, that anyway he might \nas well know the worst. \n\nSo on the eighth day he asked for her, for the early \nmorning when he was feeling refreshed and strong after \nthe night's rest. \n\nFor no reason at all, he had expected that she would \nshow some sign of her experiences, that she would look \npale and even ill. He was not prepared for the tall \nbronzed girl in a cream tussore frock with a black belt \nwho came happily through the door and stood smiling \nat him. \n\n-Good heavens, Vesper\/ he said with a wry gesture of \nwelcome, 'you look absolutely splendid. You must \nthrive on disaster. How have you managed to get such a \nwonderful sunburn? ' \n\n'I feel very guilty,' she said sitting down beside him. \n'But I've been bathing every day while you've been lying \nhere. The doctor said I was to and Head of S. said I was \nto; so— well, I just thought it wouldn't help you for me \nto be moping away all day long in my room. I've found \na wonderful stretch of sand down the coast, and I take \nmy lunch and go there every day with a book, and I \ndon't come back till the evening. There's a bus that \ntakes me there and back with only a short walk over the \ndunes, and I've managed to get over the fact that it's on \nthe way down that road to the villa. ' \n\nHer voice faltered. \n\nThe mention of the villa had made Bond's eyes \nflicker. \n\nShe continued bravely, refusing to be defeated by \nBond's lack of response. \n\n'The doctor says it won't be long before you're \nallowed up. I thought perhaps ... I thought perhaps I \ncould take you down to this beach later on. The doctor \nsays that bathing would be very good for you. ' \n\nBond grunted. \n\n'God knows when I'll be able to bathe,' he said. 'The \n\n\n\n142 CASINO ROYALE \n\ndoctor's talking through his hat. And when I can bathe \nit would probably be better for me to bathe alone for a \nbit. I don't want to frighten anybody. Apart from \nanything else\/ he glanced pointedly down the bed, 'my \nbody's a mass of scars and bruises. But you enjoy your- \nself. There's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy your- \nself.' \n\nVesper was stung by the bitterness and injustice in his \nvoice. \n\n'I'm sorry,' she said. 'I just thought ... I was just \ntrying . . .' \n\nSuddenly her eyes filled with tears. She swallowed. \n\n'I wanted ... I wanted to help you get well.' \n\nHer voice strangled. She looked piteously at him, \nfacing the accusation in his eyes and in his manner. \n■ Then she broke down and buried her face in her \nhands and sobbed. \n\n'I'm sorry,' she said in a muffled voice. 'I'm really \nsorry.' With one hand she searched for a handkerchief, \nin her bag. 'It's all my fault,' she dabbed at her eyes. 'I \nknow it's all my fault. ' \n\nBond at once relented. He put out a bandaged hand \nand laid it on her knee. \n\n'It's all right, Vesper. I'm sorry I was so rough. It's \njust that I was jealous of you in the sunshine while I'm \nstuck here. Directly I'm well enough I'll come with you, \nand you must show me your beach. Of course it's just \nwhat I want. It'll be wonderful to get out again.' \n\nShe pressed his hand and stood up and walked over to \nthe window. After a moment she busied herself with her \nmakeup. Then she came back to the bed. \n\nBond looked at her tenderly. Like all harsh, cold \nmen, he was easily tipped over into sentiment. She was \nvery beautiful, and he felt warm towards her. He \ndecided to make his questions as easy as possible. \n\nHe gave her a cigarette, and for a time they talked of \nthe visit of Head of S. and of the reactions in London to \nthe rout of LeChiffre. ; \n\n\n\nVESPER \n\n\n\n143 \n\n\n\nFrom what she said it was clear that the final object of \nthe plan had been more than fulfilled. The story was \nstill being splashed all over the world, and correspon- \ndents of most of the English and American papers had \nbeen at Royale trying to trace the Jamaican millionaire \nwho had defeated Le Chiffre at the tables. They had got \non to Vesper, but she had covered up well. Her story \nwas that Bond had told her he was going on to Cannes \nand Monte Carlo to gamble'with his winnings. The hunt \nhad moved down to the South of France. Mathis and \nthe police had obliterated all other traces, and the \npapers were forced to concentrate on the Strasbourg \nangles and the chaos in the ranks of the French com- \nmunists. \n\n'By the way, Vesper,' said Bond after a time, 'what \nreally happened \\to you after you left me in the night \nclub? All I saw was the actual kidnapping.' He told her \nbriefly of the scene outside the Casino. \n\n'I'm afraid I must have lost my head,' said Vesper, \navoiding Bond's eyes. 'When I couldn't see Mathis \nanywhere in the entrance hall I went outside, and the \ncommissionaire asked me if I was Miss Lynd, and then \ntold me the man who had sent in the note was waiting in \na car down on the right of the steps. Somehow I wasn't \nparticularly surprised. I'd only known Mathis for a day \nor two, and I didn't know how he worked, so I just \nwalked down towards the car. It was away on the right \nand more or less in the shadows. Just as I was coming \nup to it, Le Chiffre's two men jumped out from behind \none of the other cars in the row and simply scooped my \nskirt over my head. ' \n\nVesper blushed. \n\n'It sounds a childish trick,'. she looked penitently at \nBond, 'but it's really frightfully effective. One's a com- \nplete prisoner and although I screamed I don't expect \nany sound came out from under my skirt. I kicked out \nas hard as I could; but that was no use, as I couldn't see, \nand my arms were absolutely helpless. I was just a \n\n\n\n144 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\ntrussed chicken. They picked me up between them and \nshoved me into the back of the car. I went on struggling, \nof course, and when thenar started and while they were \ntrying to tie a rope or something around the top of my \nskirt over my head, I managed to get an arm free and \nthrow my bag through the window. I hope it was some \nuse.' \nBond nodded. \n\n'It was really instinctive. I just thought you'd have no \nidea what had happened to me, and I was terrified. I did \nthe first thing I could think of.' \n\nBond knew that it was him they had been after and \nthat, if Vesper hadn't thrown her bag out, they would \nprobably have thrown it out themselves directly they \nsaw him appear on the steps. , \n\n'It certainly helped,' said Bond. 'But why didn't you \nmake any sign when they finally got me after, the\" car \nsmash, when I spoke to you? I was dreadfully worried. I \nthought they might have knocked you out or \nsomething,' \n\n'I'm afraid I must have been unconscious,' said \nVesper. 1 'I fainted once from lack of air, and when I \ncame to they had cut a hole in front of my face. I must \nhave fainted again. I don't remember much until we got \nto the villa. I really only gathered you had been captured \nwhen I heard you try and come after me in the passage. ' \n\n'And they didn't touch you?' asked. Bond. 'They \ndidn't try and mess about with you while I was being \nbeaten up?' \n\n'No,' said Vesper. 'They just left me in an armchair. \nThey drank and played cards— belotte, I think it was \nfrom what I heard — and then they went to sleep. I sup- \npose that was how SMERSH got them. They bound my \nlegs and put me on a chair in a corner facing the wall, \nand I saw nothing of SMERSH. I heard some odd noises. \nI expect they woke me up. And then what sounded like \none of them falling off his chair. Then there were some \nsoft footsteps, and a door closed; and then nothing hap- \n\n\n\nVESPER \n\n\n\n145 \n\n\n\npened until Mathis and the police burst in hours later. I \nslept most of the time. I had no idea what had happened \nto you, but'— she faltered— 'I did once hear a terrible \nscream. It sounded very far away. At least, I think it \nmust have been a scream. At the time I thought it might \nhave been a nightmare.' \n\n.■'I'm afraid that must have been me,' said Bond. \n\nVesper, put out a hand and touched one of his. Her \neyes filled with tears. \n\n'It's horrible,' she said. 'The things they did to you. \nAnd it was all my fault. If only . . . ' \n\nShe buried her face in her hands. \n\n'That's all right,' said Bond comfortingly. 'It's no \ngood crying over spilt milk. It's all over now, and thank \nheavens they let you alone:' He patted her knee. 'They \nwere going to start on you when they'd got me really \nsoftened up. We've got a lot to thank SMERSH for. Now, \ncome on, let's forget about it. It certainly wasn't \nanything to do with you. Anybody could have fallen for \nthat note. Anyway, it*s all water over the dam,' he \nadded cheerfully. \n\nVesper looked at him gratefully through her tears. \n'You really promise?' she asked. 'I thought you would \nnever forgive me. I . . . I'll try and make it up to you. \nSomehow.' She looked at him. \n\nSomehow? thought Bond to himself. He looked at \nher. She was smiling at him. He smiled back, \n\n'You'd better look out,' he said. 'I may hold you to \nthat.'' \n\nShe looked into his eyes and said nothing, but the \nenigmatic challenge was back. She pressed his hand and \nrose. 'A promise is a promise,' she said. \n\nThis time they both knew what the promise was. \n\nShe picked up her bag from the bed and walked to the \ndoor. • \n\n'Shall I come tomorrow?? She looked at Bond \ngravely. \n\n'Yes, please, Vesper,' said Bond. 'I'd like that. Please \n\n\n\n146 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\ndo some more exploring. It will be fun to think of what \nwe can do when I get up. Will you think of some \nthings?' \n\n'Yes,' said Vesper. 'Please get well quickly.' \n\nThey gazed at each other for a second. Then she went \nout and closed the door, and Bond listened until the \nsound of her footsteps had died away. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22 \n\nThe Hastening Saloon \n\n\n\nFrom that day Bond' s recovery was rapid . \n\nHe sat up in bed and wrote his report to M. He made \nlight of what he still considered amateurish behaviour \non the part of Vesper. By juggling with the emphasis, he \nmade the kidnapping sound much more Machiavellian \nthan it had been. He praised Vesper's coolness and com- \nposure throughout the whole episode without saying „ \nthat he had found some of her actions unaccountable. \n\nEvery day Vesper came to see him, and he looked for- \nward to these visits with excitement. She talked happily \nof her adventures of the day before, her explorations \ndown the coast, and the restaurants where she had \neaten. She had made friends with the chief of police and \nwith one of the directors of the Casino, and it was they \nwho took her out in the evening and occasionally lent \nher a car during the day. She kept an eye on the repairs \nto the Bentley which had been towed down to coach- \nbuilders at Rouen, and she even arranged for some new \nclothes to be sent out from Bond's London flat. \n\n\n\n147 \n\n\n\n148 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nNothing survived from his original wardrobe. Every \nstitch had been cut to ribbons in the search for the forty \nmillion francs. \n\nThe Le Chiffre affair was never mentioned between \nthem. She occasionally told Bond amusing stories of \nHead of S.'s office. She had apparently transferred \nthere from the W.R.N. S. And he told her of some of his \nadventures in the Service. \n\nHe found he could speak to her easily, and he was \nsurprised. \n\nWith most women his manner was a mixture of \ntaciturnity and passion. The lengthy approaches to a \nseduction bored him almost as much as the subsequent \nmess of disentanglement. He found something grisly in \nthe inevitability of the pattern of each affair. The con- \nventional parabola — sentiment, the touch of the hand, \nthe kiss, the passionate kiss, the feel of the body, the \nclimax in the bed, then more bed, then less bed, then the \nboredom, the tears, and the final bitterness— was to him \nshameful and hypocritical. Even more he shunned the \nmise-en-scene for each of these acts in the play — the \nmeeting at a party, the restaurant, the taxi, his flat, her \nflat, then the week-end by the sea, then the flats again, \nthen the furtive alibis and the final angry farewell on \nsome doorstep in the rain. \n\nBut with Vesper there could be none of this. \n\nIn the dull room and the boredom of his treatment \nher presence was each day an oasis of pleasure, \nsomething to look forward to. In their talk there was \nnothing but companionship with a distant undertone of \npassion. In the background there was the unspoken zest \nof the promise which, in due course and in their own \ntime, would be met. Over all there brooded the shadow \nof his injuries and the tantalus of their slow healing. \n\nWhether Bond liked it or not, the branch had already \nescaped his knife and was ready to burst into flower. \n\nWith enjoyable steps Bond recovered. He was \nallowed up. Then he was allowed to sit in the garden. \n\n\n\nTHE HASTENING SALOON \n\n\n\n149 \n\n\n\nThen he could go for a short walk, then for a long drive. \nAnd then the afternoon came when the doctor appeared \non a flying visit from Paris and pronounced him well \nagain. His clothes were brought round by Vesper, \nfarewells were exchanged with the nurses, and a hired \ncar drove them away. \n\nIt was three weeks from the day when he had been on \nthe edge of death, and how it was July and the hot \nsummer shimmered down the coast and out at sea. Bond \nclasped the moment to him. \n\nTheir destination was to be a surprise for him. He had \nnot wanted to go back to one of the big hotels in Royale, \nand Vesper said she would find somewhere away from \nthe town. But she insisted on being mysterious about it \nand only said that she had found a place he would like. \nHe was happy to be in her hands, but he covered up his \nsurrender by referring to their destination as 'Trou sur \nMer' (she admitted it was by the sea), and lauding the \nrustic delights of outside lavatories, bedbugs, and \ncockroaches. \n\nTheir drive was spoiled by a curious incident. \n\nWhile they followed the coast-road in the direction of \nLes Noctambules, Bond described to her his wild chase \nin the Bentley, finally pointing out the curve he had \ntaken before the crash and the exact place where the \nvicious carpet of spikes had been laid. He slowed the car \ndown and leant out to show her the deep cuts in, the tar- \nmac made by the rims of the wheels and the broken \nbranches in the hedge and the patch of oil where the car \nhad come to rest. \n\nBut all the time she was distrait and fidgety and com- \nmented only in monosyllables. Once or twice he caught \nher glancing in the driving-mirror; but when he had a \nchartce to look back through the rear window they had \njust rounded a bend, and he could see nothing. \n\nFinally he took her hand. - \n\n'Something's on your mind, Vesper,' he said. ' \nShe gave him a taut, bright smile. 'It's nothing. Ab- \n\n\n\n150 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nsolutely nothing. I had a silly idea We were being' \nfollowed. It's just nerves, I suppose. This road is full of \nghosts.' \n\nUnder cover of a short laugh she looked back again. \n\n'Look. ' There was an edge of panic in her voice. \n\nObediently Bond turned his head. Sure enough, a \" \nquarter of a mile away, a black saloon was coming after ' \nthem at a good pace. \n\nBond laughed. \n\n'We can't be the only people using this road,' he said. \n'Anyway, who wants to follow us? We've done nothing \nwrong.' He patted her hand. 'It's a middle-aged com- \nmercial traveller in car-polish on his way to Le Havre. \nHe's probably thinking of his lunch and his mistress in \nParis. Really, Vesper, you mustn't think evil of the in- \nnocent.' \n\n'I expect you're right,' she said nervously. 'Anyway, \nwe're nearly there.' \n\nShe relapsed into silence and gazed out of the \nwindow. \n\nBond could still feel her tenseness. He smiled to him- \nself at what he took to be simply a hangover from their \nrecent adventures. But he decided to humour her, and \nwhen they came to a small lane leading towards the sea \nand slowed to turn down it, he told the driver to stop \ndirectly they were off the main road. \n\nHidden by the tall hedge, they watched together \nthrough the rear window. \n\nThrough the quiet hum of summer noises they could \nhear the car approaching. Vesper dug her fingers into \nhis arm. The pace of the car did not alter as it ap- \nproached their hiding-place and they had only a brief \nglimpse of a man's profile as a black saloon tore by. \n\nIt was true that he seemed to glance quickly towards \nthem, but above them in the hedge there was a gaily \npainted sign point down the lane announcing \n'L'Auberge du Fruit Defendu, crustaces, fritures.' It \n\n\n\nTHE HASTENING SALOON \n\n\n\n151 \n\n\n\nwas obvious to Bond that it was this that had caught the \ndriver's eye. ^ \n\nAs the rattle of the car's exhaust diminished down the \nroad, Vesper sank back into her corner. Her face was \npale. \n\n'He looked at us,' she said. 'I told you so. I knew we \nwere being followed. Now they know where we are.' \n\nBond could not contain his impatience. 'Bunkum, ' he \nsaid. 'He was looking at that sign.' He pointed it out to \nVesper. \n\nShe looked slightly relieved. 'Do you really think so?' \nshe asked. 'Yes. I see. Of course, you must be right. \nCome on. I'm sorry to be so stupid. I don't know what \ncame over me.' \n\nShe leant forward and talked to the driver through the \npartition, and the car moved on. She sank back and \nturned a bright face towards Bond. The colour had \nalmost come back to her cheeks. 'I really am sorry. It's \njust that — it's that I can't believe everything's over and \nthere's no one to be frightened of any more.' She \npressed his hand. 'You must think me very stupid.' \n\n'Of course not,' said Bond. 'But really nobody could \nbe interested in us now. Forget it all. The whole job's \nfinished, wiped up. This is our holiday, and there's not \na cloud in the sky. Is there? ' he persisted. \n\n'No, of course not.' She shook herself slightly. 'I'm \nmad. Now we'll be there in a second. I do hope you're \ngoing to like it.' \n\nThey both leant forward. Animation was back in her \nface, and the incident left only the smallest question \nmark hanging in the air. Even that faded as they came \nthrough the dunes and saw the sea and the modest little \ninn amongst the pines. \n\n'It's not very grand, I'm afraid,' said Vesper. ;But it's \nvery clean, and the food's wonderful.' She looked at \nhim anxiously. - \n\nShe need not have worried. Bond loved the place at \n\n\n\n152 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nfirst sight — the terrace leading almost to the high-tide \nmark, the low two-storied house With gay brick-red \nawnings over the windows, and the crescent-shaped bay \nof blue water and golden sand. How many times in his \nlife would he have given anything to have turned off a \nmain road to find a lost corner like this where he could \nlet the world go by and live in the sea from dawn to \ndusk! And now he was to have a whole week of this. \nAnd of Vesper. In his mind he fingered the necklace of \nthe days to come. \n\nThey drew up in the courtyard behind the house, and \nthe proprietor and his wife came out to greet them. \n\nMonsieur Versoix was a middle-aged man with one \narm. The other he had lost fighting with the Free French \nin Madagascar. He was a friend of the chief of police of \nRoyale, and it was the Commissaire who had suggested \nthe place to Vesper and had spoken to the proprietor on \nthe telephone. As a result, nothing was going to be too \ngood for them. \n\nMadame Versoix had been interrupted in the middle \nof preparing dinner. She wore an apron and held a \nwooden spoon in one hand. She was younger than her \nhusband, chubby and handsome and warm-eyed. In- \nstinctively Bond guessed that they had no children and \nthat they gave their thwarted affection to their friends \nand some regular customers, and probably to some pets. \nHe thought that their life was probably something of a \nstruggle, and that the inn must be very lonely in win- \ntertime with the big seas and the noise of the wind in the \npines. \n\nThe proprietor showed them to their rooms. \n\nVesper's was a double room, and Bond was next \ndoor, at the corner of the house, with one window \nlooking out to sea and another with a view of the distant \narm of the bay. There was a bathroom between them. \nEverything was spotless, and sparsely comfortable. \n\nThe proprietor was pleased when they both showed \ntheir delight. He said that dinner would be at seven- \n\n\n\nTHE HASTENING SALOON \n\n\n\n153 \n\n\n\nthirty and that Madame la patrOnne was preparing \nbroiled lobsters with melted butter. He was sorry that \nthey were so quiet just then. It was Tuesday. There \nwould be more people at the week-end. The season had \nnot been good. Generally they had plenty of English \npeople staying, but times were difficult over there and \nthe English just came for a week-end at Royale and then \nwent home after losing their money at the Casino. It was \nnot like the old days. He shrugged his shoulders \nphilosophically. But then no day was like the day \nbefore, and no century like the previous one, and . . . \n'Quite so, ' said Bond. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 23 \n\nTide of Passion \n\n\n\nThey were talking on the threshold of Vesper's \nroom. When the proprietor left them, Bond pushed her \ninside and closed the door. Then he put his hands on her \nshoulders and kissed her on both cheeks. \n'This is heaven, ' he said. \n\nThen he saw that her eyes were shining. Her hands \ncame up and rested on his forearms. He stepped right up \nagainst her, and his arms dropped round her waist. Her \nhead went back, and her mouth opened beneath his. \n\n'My darling,' he said. He plunged his mouth down \nonto hers and felt her respond, shyly at first, then more \npassionately. His hand slipped down her back and \npressed her body fiercely to his. Panting, she slipped her \nmouth away and they clung together; he brushed her ear \nwith his lips and felt the firm warmth of her breasts \nagainst him. Then he reached up and seized her hair and \nbent her head back until he could kiss her again. She \npushed him away and sank back exhausted on to the \nbed. For a moment they looked at each other hungrily. \n\n\n\n154 \n\n\n\nTIDE OF PASSION \n\n\n\n155 \n\n\n\n'I'm sorry, Vesper,' he said. 'I didn't mean to then.' \n• She shook her head, dumb with the storm which had \npassed through her. \n\nHe came and sat beside her, and they looked at each \nother with lingering tenderness as the tide of passion \nebbed in their veins. \n\nShe leant over and kissed him on the corner of the \nmouth, then she brushed the black comma of hair back \nfrom his damp forehead. , \n\n'My darling,' she said. 'Give me a cigarette. I don't \nknow where my bag is.' She looked vaguely round the \nroom. \n\n' Bond lit one for her and put it between her lips. She \ntook a deep lungful of smoke and let it pour out through \nher mouth with a slow sigh. \n\nBond put his arm round her, but she got up and \nwalked over to the window. She stood there with her \nback to him. \n\nBond looked down at his hands and saw they were \nstill trembling. \n\n'It's going to take some time to get ready for dinner,' \nsaid Vesper, still not looking at him. 'Why don't you go \nand bathe? I'll unpack for you.' \n\nBond left the bed and came and stood close against \nher. He put his arms round her and put a hand over each \nbreast. They filled his hands and the nipples were hard \nagainst his fingers. She put her hands over his and \npressed them into her, but she still looked away from \nhim out of the window. \n\n'Not now,' she said in a low voice \n\nBond bent and burrowed his lips into the nape of her \nneck. For a moment he strained her hard to him, then he \nlet her go. \n\n'All right, Vesper,' he said. \n\nHe walked over to the door and looked back. She had \nnot moved. For some reason he thought she was crying. \nHe took a step towards her and then realized that there \nwas nothing to say between them then. \n\n\n\n156 CASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\n'My love,' he said. \n\nThen he went out and shut the door. \n\nBond walked along to his room and sat down on the \nbed. He felt weak from the passion which had swept \nthrough his body. He was torn between the desire to fall \nback full-length on the bed and his longing to be cooled \nand revived by the sea. He played with the choice for a \nmoment, then he went over to his suitcase and took out \nwhite linen bathing-trunks and a dark blue pyjama-suit. \n\nBond had always disliked pyjamas and had slept \nnaked until in Hong Kong at the end of the war he came \nacross the perfect compromise. This was a pyjama-coat \nwhich came almost down to the knees. It had no \nbuttons, but there was a loose belt round the waist. The \nsleeves were wide and short, ending just above the \nelbow. The result was cool and comfortable, and now \nwhen he slipped the coat on over his trunks, all his \nbruises and scars were hidden except the thin white \nbracelets on wrists and ankles and the mark of SMERSH \non his right hand. i \n\nHe slipped his feet into a pair of dark-blue leather \nsandals and went downstairs and out of the house and \nacross the terrace to the beach. As he passed across the \nfront of the house he thought of Vesper; but he \nrefrained from looking up to see if she was still standing \nat the window. If she saw him, she gave no sign. \n\nHe walked along the waterline on the hard golden \nsand until he was out of sight of the inn. Then he threw \noff his pyjama-coat .and took a short run and a quick \nflat dive into the small waves. The beach shelved quickly \nand he kept under water as long as he could, swimming \nwith powerful strokes and feeling the soft coolness all \nover him. Then he surfaced and brushed the hair out of \nhis eyes. It was nearly seven, and the sun had lost much \nof its heat. Before long it would sink beneath the further \narm of the bay; but now it was straight in his eyes, and \nhe turned on his back and swam away from it so that he \ncould keep it with him as long as possible. \n\n\n\nTIDE OF PASSION \n\n\n\n157 \n\n\n\nWhen he came ashore nearly a mile down the bay the \nshadows had already engulfed his distant pyjamas; but \nhe knew he had time to lie on the hard sand and dry \nbefore the tide of dusk reached him. \n\nHe took off his bathing trunks and looked down at \nhis body. There were only a few traces left of his in- \njuries. He shrugged his shoulders and lay down with his \nlimbs spread out in a star and gazed up at the empty \nblue sky and thought of Vesper. \n\nHis feelings for her were confused, and he was im- \npatient with the confusion. They had been so simple. He \nhad intended to sleep with her as soon as he could, \nbecause he desired her and also because — he admitted it \nto himself— he wanted coldly to put the repairs to his \nbody to the final test. He thought they would sleep \ntogether for a few days and then he might see something \nof her in London. Then would come the inevitable \ndisengagement which would be all the easier because of \ntheir positions in the Service. If it was not easy, he could \ngo off on an assignment abroad or— which was also in \nhis mind — he could resign and travel to different parts \nof the world as he had always wanted. \n\nBut somehow she had crept under his skin, and over \nthe last two weeks his feelings had gradually changed. \n\nHe found her companionship easy and unexacting. \nThere was something enigmatic about her which was a \nconstant stimulus. She gave little of her real personality \naway, and he felt that, however long they were together, \nthere would always be a private room inside her which \nhe could never invade. She was thoughtful and full of \nconsideration without being slavish and without com- \npromising her arrogant spirit. And now he knew that \nshe was profoundly, excitingly sensual, but that the \nconquest of her body, because of the central privacy in \nher, would each time have the tang of rape. Loving her \nphysically would each time be a thrilling voyage without \nthe anticlimax of arrival. She would surrender herself \navidly, he thought, and greedily enjoy all the intimacies \n\n\n\n158 . -| CASINO ROYALE . \n\nof the bed without ever allowing herself to be possessed. \n\nNaked, Bond lay and Jxied to push away the con- \nclusions he read in the sky. He turned his head and \nlooked down the beach and saw that the shadows of the \nheadland were almost reaching for him. \n\nHe stood up and brushed off as much of the sand as \nhe could reach. He reflected that he would have a bath \nwhen he got in and he' absent-mindedly picked up his \ntrunks and started walking back along the beach. It was \nonly when he reached his pyjama-coat and bent to pick \nit up that he realized he was still naked. Without \nbothering about the trunks, he slipped on the light coat \nand walked on to the hotel. \n\nAt that moment his mind was made up. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 24 \n\n'Fruit D§fendu' \n\n\n\nWhen he got back to his room he was touched to \nfind all his belongings put away and in the bathroom his \ntoothbrush and shaving things neatly arranged at one \nend of the glass shelf over the washbasin. At the other \nend were Vesper's toothbrush and one or two small \nbottles and a jar of face-cream. \n\nHe glanced at the bottles and was surprised to see that \none contained Nembutal sleeping pills. Perhaps her \nnerves had been more shaken by the events at the villa \nthan he had imagined. \n\nThe bath had been filled for him, and there was a new \nflask of some expensive pine bath-essence on a chair \nbeside it with his towel. \n\n'Vesper,' he called. \n\n'Yes?' \n\n'You really are the limit. You make me feel like an ex- \npensive gigolo.' \n\n'I was told to look after you. I'm only doing what I \nwas told.' \n\n\n\n159 \n\n\n\n160 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\n'Darling, the bath's absolutely right. Will you marry \\ \nme?' \n\nShe snorted. 'You need a slave, not a wife. ' \n'I want you.' \n\n'Well, I want my lobster and champagne, so hurry \nup.' \n\n'AH right, all right, ' said Bond. \n. He dried himself and dressed in a white shirt and dark \nblue slacks. He hoped that she would be dressed as \nsimply, and he was pleased when, without knocking, she \nappeared in the doorway wearing a blue linen shirt \nwhich had faded to the colour of her eyes and a dark red \nskirt in pleated cotton. \n\n'I couldn't wait. I was famished. My room's over the \nkitchen, and I've been tortured by the wonderful \nsmells.' \n\nHe came over and put his arm round her. \n\nShe took his hand, and together they went downstairs \nand out on to the terrace where their table had been laid \nin the light cast by the empty dining-room. \n\nThe champagne which Bond had ordered on their \narrival stood in a plated wine-cooler beside their table, \nand Bond poured out two full glasses. Vesper busied \nherself with a delicious homemade liver pate and helped \nthem both to the crisp French bread and the thick \nsquares of deep yellow butter set in chips of ice. \n\nThey looked at each other and drank deeply, and \nBond filled their glasses again to the rim. \n\nWhile they ate Bond told her of his bathe, and they \ntalked of what they would do in the morning. All \nthrough the meal 7 they left unspoken their feelings for \neach other, but in Vesper's eyes as much as in Bond's \nthere was excited anticipation of the night. They let their \nhands and feet touch from time to time as if to ease the \ntension in their bodies. \n\nWhen the lobster had come and gone and the second \nbottle of champagne was half empty and they had just \n\n\n\n'FRUIT DEFENDU' \n\n\n\n161 \n\n\n\nladled thick cream over their fraises des bois, Vesper \ngave a deep sigh of contentment. \n\n'I'm behaving like a pig\/ she said happily. 'You \nalways give me all the things I like best. I've never been \nso spoiled before.' She gazed across the terrace at the \nmoonlit bay. 'I wish I deserved it.' Her voice had a wry \nundertone. \n\n'What do you mean?' asked Bond surprised. , \n\n'Oh, I don't know. I suppose people get what they \ndeserve, so perhaps I do deserve it.' \n\nShe looked at him and smiled. Her eyes narrowed \nquizzically. ' \n\n'You really don't know much about me,' she said \nsuddenly. \n\nBond was surprised by the undertone of seriousness in \nher voice. \n\n'Quite enough,' he said laughing. 'All I need until \ntomorrow and the next day and the next. You don't' \nknow much about me for the matter of that.' He poured \nout more champagne. \n. Vesper looked at him thoughtfully. \n\n'People are islands,' she said. 'They don't really \ntouch. However close they are, they're really quite \nseparate. Even if they've been married for fifty years. ' \n\nBond thought with dismay that she must be going into \na 'vin triste.' Tdo much champagne had made her \nmelancholy. But suddenly she gave a happy laugh. , \n' 'Don't look so worried.' She leaned forward and put \nher hand over his. 'I was only being sentimental. \nAnyway, my island feels very close to your island \ntonight.' She took a sip of champagne. ' \n\nBond laughed, relieved. 'Let's join up and make a \npeninsula,' he said. 'Now, directly we've finished the \nstrawberries.' \n\n'No, ' she said, flirting^ 'I must have coffee. ' \n\n'And brandy,' countered Bond. : ' \n\nThe small shadow had passed. The second small \n\n\n\n162 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nshadow. This too left a tiny question-mark hanging in \nthe air. It quickly dissolved as warmth and intimacy en- \nclosed them again. \n\nWhen they had had their coffee and Bond was sipping \nhis brandy, Vesper picked up her bag and came and \nstood behind him. \n\n'I'm tired,' she said, resting a hand on his shoulder. \n\nHe reached up and held it there, and they stayed \nmotionless for a moment. She bent down and lightly \nbrushed his hair with her lips. Then she was gone, and a \nfew seconds later the light came on in her room. \n\nBond smoked and waited until it had gone out. Then \nhe followed her, pausing only to say good night to the \nproprietor and his wife and thank them for the dinner. \nThey exchanged compliments, and he went upstairs. \n\nIt was only half-past nine when he stepped into her \nroom from the bathroom and closed the door behind \nhim. \n\nThe moonlight shone through the half-closed shutters \nand lapped at the secret shadows in the snow of her \nbody on the broad bed. \n\nBond awoke in his own room at dawn, and for a time \nhe lay and stroked his memories. \n\nThen he got quietly out of bed, and in his pyjama- \ncoat he crept past Vesper's door and out of the house to \nthe beach. \n\nThe sea was smooth and quiet in the sunrise. The \nsmall pink waves idly licked the sand. It was cold, but he \ntook off his jacket and wandered naked along the edge \nof the sea to the point where he had bathed the evening \nbefore, then he walked slowly and deliberately into the \nwater until it was just below his chin. He took his feet \noff the bottom and sank, holding his nose with one \nhand and shutting his eyes, feeling the cold water comb \nhis body and his hair. \n\nThe mirror of the bay was unbroken except where it \nseemed a fish had jumped. Under the water he imagined \n\n\n\nthe tranquil scene and wished *th«t Vesper could' just \nthen come through the pines .and be astonished to see \nhim suddenly erupt from the empty seascape. \n\nWhen after a full minute he came to the surface in a \nfroth of spray, he was disappointed. There was no one \nin sight. For a time he swam and drifted, and then when \nthe sun seemed hot enough, he came in to the beach and \nlay on his back and revelled in the body which the night \nhad given back to him. \n\nAs on the evening before, he stared up into the empty \nsky and saw the same answer there. \n\nAfter a while he rose and walked back slowly along \nthe beach to his pyjama-coat. \n\nThat day he would ask Vesper to marry him. He was \nquite certain. It was only a question of choosing the \nright moment. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 25 \n\n'Black-patch' \n\n\n\nAs he walked quietly from the terrace into the \nhalf^-darkness of the still shuttered dining-room, he was \nsurprised to see Vesper emerge from the glass-fronted \ntelephone booth near the front door and softly turn up \nthe stairs towards their rooms. \n\n'Vesper,' he called, thinking she must have had some \nurgent message which might concern them both. \n\nShe turned quickly, a hand up to her mouth. \n\nFor a moment longer than necessary she stared at \nhim, her eyes wide. \n\n'What is it, darling?' he asked, vaguely troubled and \nfearing some crisis in their lives. \n\n'Oh,' she said breathlessly, 'you made me jump. It \nwas only ... I was just telephoning to Mathis. To \nMathis,' she repeated. 'I wondered if he could get me \nanother frock. You know, from that girl-friend I told \nyou about. The vendeuse. You see' — she talked quickly, \nher words coming out in a persuasive jumble — 'I've \n\n\n\n164 \n\n\n\n'BLACK-PATCH' \n\n\n\n165 \n\n\n\nreally got nothing to wear, I thought I'd catch him at \nhome before he went to the office. I don't know my \nfriend's telephone number, and I thought it would be a \nsurprise for you. I didn't want you to hear me moving \nand wake you up. Is the water nice? Have you bathed? \nYou ought to have waited for me. ' \n\n'It's wonderful,' said Bond, deciding to relieve her \nmind, though irritated with her obvious guilt over this \nchildish mystery. 'You must go in, and then we'll have \nbreakfast on the terrace. I'm ravenous. I'm sorry I \nmade you jump. I was just startled to see anyone about \nat this hour of the morning.\" \n\nHe put his arm round her; but she disengaged herself, \nand moved quickly on up the stairs. : \n\n'It was such a surprise to see you,' she said, trying to \ncover the incident up with a light touch. \n\n'You looked like, a ghost, a drowned man, with the \nhair down over your eyes like;: that.' She laughed \nharshly. Hearing the harshness, she turned the laugh \ninto a cough. ; . \n\n'I hope I haven't caught cold\/ she said. \n\nShe kept on patching up the edifice of her deceit until \nBond wanted to spank her and tell her to relax and tell \nthe truth. Instead he just gave her a reassuring pat on \nthe back outside her room and told her to hurry up and \nhave her bathe. \n\nThen he went on to his room. * \n\nThat was the end of the integrity of their love. The \nsucceeding days were a shambles of falseness and \nhypocrisy, mingled with her tears and moments of \nanimal passion to which she abandoned herself with \ngreed made indecent by the hollowness of their days. \n\nSeveral times Bond tried to break down the dreadful \nwalls of mistrust. Again and again he brought Up the \nsubject of the telephone call; but she obstinately \nbolstered Up her story with embellishments which Bond \nknew she had thought out afterwards. She even accused \nBond of thinking she had another lover. \n\n\n\n166 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nThese scenes always ended in her bitter tears and in \nmoments almost of hysteria. \n\nEach day the atmosphere became more hateful . \n\nIt seemed fantastic to Bond that human relationships \ncould collapse into dust overnight, and he searched his \nmind again and again for a reason. \n\nHe felt that Vesper was just as horrified as he was, \nand, if anything, her misery seemed greater than his. \nBut the mystery of the telephone conversation which \nVesper angrily, almost fearfully it seemed to Bond, \nrefused to explain was a shadow which grew darker with \nother small mysteries and reticences. \n\nAlready at luncheon on that day things got worse. \n\nAfter a breakfast which was an effort for both of \nthem, Vesper said she had a headache and would stay in \nher room out of the sun. Bond took a book and walked \nfor miles down the beach. By the time he returned he \nhad argued to himself that they would be able to sort the \nproblem out over lunch. \n\nDirectly they sat down, he apologized gaily for having \nstartled her at the telephone booth and then he \ndismissed the subject and went on to describe what he \nhad seen on his walk. But Vesper was distrait and com- \nmented only in monosyllables. She toyed With her food, \nand she avoided Bond's eyes and gazed past him with an \nair of preoccupation. \n\nWhen she had failed once or twice to respond to some \nconversational gambit or other, Bond also relapsed into \nsilence and occupied himself with his own gloomy \nthoughts. \n\nAll of a sudden she stiffened. Her fork fell with a \nclatter on to the edge of her plate and then noisily off \nthe table on to the terrace. \n\nBond looked up. She had gone as white as a sheet, \nand she was looking over his shoulder with terror in her \nface. \n\nBond turned his head and saw that a man had just \ntaken his place at a table on the opposite side of the \n\n\n\n'BLACK-PATCH* - ■ 1j37 \n\nterrace, well away from them. He seemed ordinary \nenough, perhaps rather sombrely dressed; but in his first \nquick glance Bond put him down as some businessman \non his way along the coast who had just happened on \nthe inn or had picked it out of the Michelin. \n\n'What is it, darling? ' he asked anxiously. \n\nVesper's eyes never moved from the distant figure. \n\n'It's the man in the car,' she said in a stifled voice. \n'The man who was following us. I know it is. ' \n\nBond looked again over his shoulder. The patron was \ndiscussing the menu with the new customer. It was a \nperfectly normal scene. They exchanged smiles over \nsome item on the menu and apparently agreed that it \nwould suit, for the patron took the card and with, Bond \nguessed, a final exchange about the wine, withdrew. \n\nThe man seemed to realize that he was being watched. \nHe looked up and gazed incuriously at them for a \nmoment. Then he reached for a brief-case on the chair \nbeside him, extracted a newspaper, and started to read \nit, his elbows propped up on the table. \n\nWhen the man had turned his face towards them, \nBond noticed that he had a black patch over one eye. It \nwas not tied with a tape across, the eye, but screwed in \nlike a monocle. Otherwise he seemed a friendly middle- \naged man, with dark brown hair brushed straight back \nand, as Bond had seen while he was talking to the \npatron, particularly large, white teeth. \n\nHe turned back to Vesper. 'Really, darling. He looks \nvery innocent. Are you sure he's the same man? We \ncan' t expect to have this place entirely to ourselves. ' \n\nVesper's face was still a white mask. She was clutching \nthe edge of the table with both hands. He thought she \nwas going to faint and almost rose to come round to \nher, but she made a gesture to stop him. Then she \nreached for a glass of wine and took a deep draught. \nThe glass rattled on her teeth, and she brought up her \nother hand to help. Then she put the glass down. \n\nShe looked at him with dull eyes. \n\n\n\n168 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\n'I know it's the same.' \n\nHe tried to reason with her, but she paid no attention. \nAfter glancing once or twice over his shoulder with eyes \nthat held a curious submissiveness, she said that her \nheadache was still bad and that she would spend the \nafternoon in her room. She left the table and walked in- \ndoors without a backward glance. \n\nBond was determined to set her mind at rest. He \nordered coffee to be brought to the table, and then he \nrose and walked swiftly through to the courtyard. The \nblack Peugeot which stood there might indeed have \nbeen the saloon they had seen, but it might equally have \nbeen one of a million others on the French roads. He \ntook a quick glance inside, but the interior, was empty \nand when he tried the boot, it was locked. He made a \nnote of the Paris number-plate; then he went quickly to \nthe lavatory adjoining the dining-room, pulled the \nchain, and walked out on to the terrace. \n\nThe man was eating and didn't look up. \n\nBond sat down in Vesper's chair so that he could \nwatch the other table. . \n\nA few minutes later the man asked for the bill, paid it, \nandieft. Bond heard the Peugeot start up, and soon the \nnoise of its exhaust had disappeared in the direction of \nthe road to Royale. \n\nWhen the patron came back to his table, Bond ex- \nplained that Madame had unfortunately a slight touch \nof sunstroke. After the patron had expressed his regret \nand enlarged on the dangers of going out of doors in \nalmost any weather, Bond casually asked about the \nother customer. 'He reminds me of a friend who also \nlost an eye. They wear similar black patches.' \n\nThe patron answered that the man was a stranger. He \nhad been pleased with his lunch and had said that he \nwould be passing that way again in a day or two and \nwould take another meal at the auberge. Apparently he \nwas Swiss, which could also be seen from his accent. He \nwas a traveller in watches. It was shocking to have only \n\n\n\n'BLACK-PATCH' \n\n\n\n169 \n\n\n\none eye. The strain of keeping that patch in place all day \nlong. He supposed one got used to it. \n\n'It is indeed very sad,' said Bond. 'You also have been \nunlucky,' he gestured to the proprietor's empty sleeve. \n'I myself was very fortunate. ' \n\nFor a time they talked about the war. Then Bond \nrose. \n\n'By the way,' he said, 'Madame had an early \ntelephone call which I must remember to pay for. Paris. \nAn Elysee number, I think,' he added, remembering \nthat that was Mathis's exchange. \n\n'Thank you, monsieur, but the matter is regulated. I \nwas speaking to Royale this morning and the exchange \nmentioned that one of my guests had put through a call \nto Paris and that there had been no answer. They \nwanted to know if Madame would like the call kept in. \nI'm afraid the matter escaped my mind. Perhaps Mon- \nsieur would mention it to Madame. But, let me see, it \nwas an Invalides number the exchange referred to. ' \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 26 \n\n'Sleep Well, My Darling' \n\n\n\nThe next two days were much the same. \n\nOn the fourth day of their stay Vesper went off early \nto Royale. A taxi came and fetched her and brought her \nback. She said she needed some medicine. \n\nThat night she made a special effort to be gay. She \ndrank a lot, and when they went upstairs she led him \ninto her bedroom and made passionate love to him. \nBond's body responded; but afterwards she cried bit- \nterly into her pillow, and Bond went to his room in grim \ndespair. < \n\nHe could hardly sleep, and in the early hours he heard \nher door open softly. Some small sounds came from \ndownstairs. He was sure she was in the telephone-booth. \nVery soon he heard her door softly close, and he guessed \nthat again there had been no reply from Paris. \n\nThis was Saturday. \n\nOn Sunday the man with the black patch was back \nagain. Bond knew it, directly he looked up from his \nlunch and saw her face. He had told her all that the \n\n\n\n170 \n\n\n\n'SLEEP WELL, MY DARLING \n\n\n\n171 \n\n\n\npatron had told him, withholding only the man's \nstatement that he might be back. He had thought it \nwould worry her. \n\nHe had also telephoned Mathis in Paris and checked \non the Peugeot. It had been hired from a respectable \nfirm two weeks before. The customer had had a Swiss \ntriptique. His name was Adoiph Gettler. He had given a \nbank in Zurich as his address. \n\nMathis had got on to the Swiss police. Yes, the bank \nhad an account in his name. It was little used- Herr \nGettler was understood to be connected with the watch \nindustry. Inquiries could be pursued if there was a \ncharge against him. \n\nVesper had shrugged her shoulders at the in- \nformation. \n\nThis time when the man appeared she left her lunch in \nthe middle and went straight up to her room. \n\nBond made up his mind.
