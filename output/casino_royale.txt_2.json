And he told her how the Muntzes had been con- \nfounded. \n\n'Incidentally,' he asked, 'how did you come to get \nmixed up in this affair? What section are you in?' \n\n'I'm personal assistant to Head of S,' said Vesper. \n'As it was his plan he wanted his section to have a hand \nin the operation, and he asked M. if I could go. It \nseemed only to be a liaison job, so M. said yes although \nhe told my chief that you would be furious at being \ngiven a woman to work with.' She paused and, when \nBond said nothing, continued: 'I had to meet Mathis in \nParis and come down with him. I've got a friend who is \na vendeuse with Dior, and somehow she managed to \nborrow me this and the frock I was wearing this morn- \ning; otherwise I couldn't possibly have competed with \nall these people.' She made a gesture towards the room. \n'The office was very jealous although they didn't know \nwhat the job was. All they knew was that I was to work \nwith a Double O. Of course you're our heroes. I was en- \nchanted.' \n\nBond frowned. 'It's not difficult to get a Double O \nnumber if you're prepared to kill people,' he said. \n'That's all the meaning it has. It's nothing to be par- \nticularly proud of. I've got the corpses of a Japanese \ncipher expert in New York and a Norwegian double \n\n\n\nTHE GAME IS BACCARAT \n\n\n\n59 \n\n\n\nagent in Stockholm to thank for being a Double O. \nProbably quite decent people. They just got caught up \nin the gale of the world like that Yugoslav that Tito \nbumped off. It's a confusing business; but if it's one's \nprofession one does what one's told. How do you like \nthe grated egg with your caviar? ' \n\n'It's a wonderful combination,' she said. 'I'm loving \nmy dinner. It seems a shame — ' She stopped, warned by \na cold look in Bond's eye. \n\n'If it wasn't for the job, we wouldn't be here,' he \nsaid. \n\nSuddenly he regretted the intimacy of their dinner and \nof their talk. He felt that he had said too much and what \nwas only a working relationship had become confused. \n\n'Let's consider what has to be done,' he said in a \nmatter-of-fact voice. 'I'd better explain what I'm going \nto try and do, and how you can help. Which isn't very \nmuch, I'm afraid,' he added. 'Now these are the basic \nfacts.' He proceeded to sketch out the plan and \nenumerate the various contingencies which faced them. \n\nThe maltre d'hdtel surpervised the serving of the \nsecond course, and then as they ate the delicious food \nBond continued. \n\nShe listened to him coldly, but with attentive obedi- \nence. She- felt thoroughly deflated by his harshness, \nwhile admitting to herself that she should have paid \nmore heed to the warnings of Head of S. \n\n'He's a dedicated man,' her chief had said when he \ngave her the assignment. 'Don't imagine this is going to \nbe any fun. He thinks of nothing but the job on hand \nand, while it's on, he's absolute hell to work for. But \nhe's an expert, and there aren't many about; so you \nwon't be wasting your time. He's a good-looking \nchap— but don't fall for him. I don't think he's got \nmuch heart. Anyway, good luck, and don't get hurt. ' \n\nAll this had been something of a challenge, and she \nwas pleased when she felt she attracted and interested \nhim, as she knew intuitively that she did. Then at a hint \n\n\n\n60 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nthat they were finding pleasure together, a hint that was \nonly the first words of a conventional phrase, he had \nsuddenly turned to ice and had brutally veered away as \nif warmth were poison to him. She felt hurt and foolish. \nThen she gave a mental shrug and concentrated with all \nher attention on what he was saying. She would not \nmake the same mistake again. \n\n' . . . and the main hope is to pray for a run of luck for \nme, or against him.' \n\nBond was explaining just how baccarat is played. \n\n'It's much the same as any other gambling game. The \nodds against the banker and the player are more or less \neven. Only a run against either can be decisive and \n' 'break the bank, ' ' or break the players. \n\n• 'Tonight, Le Chiffre, we know, has bought the bac- \ncarat bank from the Egyptian syndicate which is run- \nning the high tables here. He paid a million francs for it, \nand his capital has'been reduced to twenty-four million. \nI have about the same. There will be ten players, I ex- \npect, and we sit round the banker at a kidney-shaped \ntable. \n\n'Generally, this table is divided into two tableaux. \nThe banker plays two games, one against each of the \ntableaux to left and right of him. In that game, the \nbanker should be able to win by playing off one tableau \nagainst the other and by first-class accountancy. But \nthere aren't enough baccarat players yet at Royale, and \nLe Chiffre is just going to pit his luck against the other \nplayers at the single tableau. It's , unusual because the \nodds in favour of the banker aren't so good; but they're \na shade in his favour and, of course, he has control of \nthe size of the stakes. \n\n'Well, the banker sits there in the middle with a \ncroupier to rake in the cards and call the amount of each \nbank and a chef de partie to umpire the game generally. \nI shall be sitting as near dead opposite Le Chiffre as I \ncan get. In front of him he has a shoe containing six \npacks of cards, well shuffled. There's absolutely no \n\n\n\nTHE GAME IS BACCARAT \n\n\n\n61 \n\n\n\nchance of tampering with the shoe. The cards are shuf- \nfled by the croupier and cut bygone of the players and \nput into the shoe in full view of the table. We've \nchecked on the staff, and they're all okay. It would be \nuseful, but almost impossible, to mark all the cards, and \nit would mean the connivance at least of the croupier. \nAnyway, we shall be watching for that too. ' \n\n•Bond drank some champagne and continued. \n\n'Now what happens at the game is this. The banker \nannounces an opening bank of five hundred thousand \nfrancs, or five hundred pounds as it is now. Each seat is \nnumbered from the right of the banker, and the player \nnext to the banker, or Number 1, can accept this bet and \npush his money out on to the table, or pass it if it is too \nmuch or he doesn't want to take it. Then Number 2 has \nthe right to take it; and if he refuses then Number 3, and \nso on round the table. If no single player takes it all, the \nbet is offered to the table as a whole and everyone chips \nin, including sometimes the spectators round the table, \nuntil the five hundred thousand is made up. \n\n'That is a small bet which would immediately be met, \nbut when it gets to a million or two, it's often difficult to \nfind a taker or even, if the bank seems to be in luck, a \ngroup of takers to cover the bet. At that moment I shall \nalways try and step in and accept the bet— in fact, I shall \nattack Le Chiffre's bank whenever I get a chance until \neither I've bust his bank or he's bust me. It may take \nsome time, but in the end one of us two is bound to \nbreak the other, irrespective of the other players at the \ntable, although they can, of course, make him richer or \npoorer in the meantime. \n\n'Being the banker, he's got a slight advantage in the \nplay; but knowing that I'm making a dead set at him \nand now knowing, I hope, my capital, is bound to play \non his nerves a bit, so I'm hoping that we start about \nequal.' \n\nHe paused while the strawberries came, and the \navocado pear. \n\n\n\n62 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nFor a while they ate in silence, then they talked of \nother things while the coffee was served. They smoked. \nNeither of them drank brandy or a liqueur. Finally, \nBond felt it was time to explain the actual mechanics of \nthe game. \n\n'It's a simple affair,' he said, 'and you'll understand \nit at once if you've ever played vingt-et-un, where the \nobject is to get cards from the banker which add up \nmore closely to a count of twenty-one than his do. In \nthis game I get two cards and the banker gets two; and, \nunless anyone wins outright, either or both of us can get \none more card. The object of the game is to hold two, or \nthree cards which together count nine points, Or as \nnearly nine as possible. Court cards and tens count \nnothing; aces one each; any other card its face value. It \nis only the last figure of your count that signifies. So \nnine plus seven equals six — not sixteen. \n\n'The winner is the one whose count, is nearest to nine. \nDraws are played over again.' \n\nVesper listened attentively, but she also watched the \nlook of abstract passion on Bond's face. \n\n'Now,' Bond continued, 'when the banker deals me \nmy two cards, if they add up to eight or nine, they're a \n\"natural\" and I turn them up and I win, unless he has \nan equal or a better natural. If I haven't got a natural, I \ncan stand on a seven or a six, perhaps ask for a card or \nperhaps not, on a five, and certainly ask for a card if my \ncount is lower than five. Five is the turning point of the \ngame. According to the odds, the chance of bettering or \nworsening your hand if you hold a five are exactly even. \n\n'Only when I ask for a card or tap mine to signify that \nI stand on what I have, can the banker look at his. If he \nhas a natural, he turns them up and wins. Otherwise he \nis faced with the same problems as I was. But he is \nhelped in his decision to draw or not to draw a card by \nmy actions. If I have stood he must assume that I have a \nfive, six, or seven: if I have drawn, he will know that I \nhad something less than a six and I may have improved \n\n\n\nTHE GAME IS BACCARAT \n\n\n\n63 \n\n\n\nmy hand or not with the card he gave me. And this card \nwas dealt to me face up. On its face value and a \nknowledge of the odds, he will know whether to take \nanother card or to stand on his own. \n\n'So he has a very slight advantage over me. He has a \ntiny help over his decision to draw or to stand. But there \nis always one problem card at this game: Shall one draw \nor stand on a five, and what will your opponent do with \na five? Some players always draw or always stand,. I \nfollow my intuition. '...',■!' \n\n'But in the end' — Bond stubbed out his cigarette and \ncalled for the bill — 'it's the natural eights and nines that \nmatter, and I must just see that I get more of them than \nhe does.' \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10 \n\nThe High Table \n\n\n\nWhile telling the story of the game and an- \nticipating the coming fight, Bond's face had lit up \nagain. The prospect of at last getting to grips with \nLe Chiffre stimulated him and quickened his pulse. He \nseemed to have completely forgotten the brief coolness \nbetween them, and Vesper was relieved and entered into \nhis mood. \n\nHe paid the bill and gave a handsome tip to the som- \nmelier. Vesper rose and led the way out of the restaurant \nand out on to the steps of the hotel. \n\nThe big Bentley was waiting and Bond drove Vesper \nover, parking as close to the entrance as he could. As \nthey walked through the ornate anterooms, he hardly \nspoke. She looked at him and saw that his nostrils were , \nslightly flared. In other respects he seemed completely at \nease, acknowledging cheerfully the greetings of the \nCasino functionaries. At the door to the salle privee \nthey were not asked for their membership cards. Bond's \nhigh gambling had already made him a favoured client, \n\n\n\n64 \n\n\n\nTHE HIGH TABLE \n\n\n\n65 \n\n\n\nand any companion of his shared in the glory. \n\nBefore they had penetrated very far into the main \nroom, Felix Leiter detached himself from one of the \nroulette tables and greeted Bond as an old friend., After \nbeing introduced to Vesper Lynd and exchanging a few \nremarks, Leiter said: 'Well, since you're playing bac- \ncarat this evening, will you allow me to show Miss Lynd \nhow to break the bank at roulette? I've got three lucky \nnumbers that are bound to show soon, and I expect Miss \nLynd has some too. Then perhaps we could come and \nwatch you when your game starts to warm up. ' \n\nBond looked inquiringly at Vesper. \n\n'I should love that,' she said. 'But will you give me \none of your lucky numbers to play on? ' \n\n'I have no lucky numbers,' said Bond unsmilingly. 'I \nonly bet on even chances, or as near them as I can get. \nWell, I shall leave you then.' He excused himself. 'You \nwill be in excellent hands with .my friend Felix Leiter. ' \nHe gave a short smile which' embraced them both and \nwalked with an unhurried gait towards the caisse. \n\nLeiter sensed the rebuff, \n\n'He's a very serious gambler, Miss Lynd,' he said. \n'And I guess he has to be. Now come with me and watch \nNumber 17 obey my extrasensory perceptions. You'll \nfind it quite a painless sensation being given plenty of \nmoney for nothing. ' \n\nBond was relieved to be on his own again and tq be \nable to clear his mind of everything but the task on \nhand. He stood at the caisse and took his twenty-four \nmillion francs against the receipt which had been given \nhim that afternoon. He divided the notes into equal , \npackets and put half the sum into his right-hand coat \npocket and the other half into the left. Then he strolled \nslowly across the room between the thronged tables \nuntil he came to the top of the room where the broad \nbaccarat table waited behind the brass rail. \n\nThe table was filling up, and the cards were spread \nface down, being stirred and mixed slowly in what is \n\n\n\n66 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nknown as the 'croupiers' shuffle' — supposedly the \nshuffle which is most effective and least susceptible to \ncheating. \n\nThe chef de partie lifted the velvet-covered chain \nwhich allowed entrance through the brass rail. \n\n'I've kept Number 6 as you wished, Monsieur Bond.' \n\nThere were still three other empty places at the table. \nBond moved inside the rail to which a huissier was \nholding out his chair. He sat down with a nod to the \nplayers on his right and left. He took out his wide gun- \nmetal cigarette case and his black lighter and placed \nthem on the green baize at his right elbow. The huissier \nwiped a thick glass ashtray with a cloth and put it beside \nthem. Bond lit a cigarette and leant back in his chair. \n\nOpposite him, the banker's chair was vacant. He \nglanced round the table. He knew most of the players by \nsight, but, few of their names. At Number 7, on his \nright, there was a Monsieur Sixte, a wealthy Belgian \nwith metal interests in the Congo. At Number 9 there \nwas Lord Danvers, a distinguished but weak-looking \nman whose francs were presumably provided by his rich \nAmerican wife, a middle-aged woman with the \npredatory mouth of a barracuda, who sat at Number 3 . \nBond reflected that they would probably play a pawky \nand nervous game and be amongst the early casualties. \nAt Number 1 , to the right of the bank, was a well- \nknown Greek gambler who owned, as in Bond's ex- \nperience apparently everyone does in the eastern \nMediterranean, a profitable shipping line. He would \nplay coldly and well and would be a stayer. \n\nBond asked the huissier for a card and wrote on it, \nunder a neat question mark, the remaining numbers, 2, \n4, 5, 8, 10, and asked the huissier to give it to the chef de \npartie. \n\nSoon it came back with the names filled in. \nNumber 2, still empty, was to be Carmel Delane, the \nAmerican film star with alimony from three husbands \n\n\n\nTHE HIGH TABLE 67 \n\nto burn and, Bond assumed, a call on still more from \nwhoever her present companion at Royale might be. \nWith her sanguine temperament she would play gaily \nand with panache and might run into a vein of luck. \n\nThen came Lady Danvers at Number 3 and Numbers \n4 and 5 were a Mr. and Mrs. Du Pont, rich-looking, \nwho might or might not have some of the real Du Pont \nmoney behind them. Bond guessed they would be \nstayers. They both had a businesslike look about them \nand were talking together easily and cheerfully as if they \nfelt very much at home at the big game. Bond was quite \nhappy to have them next to him— Mrs. Du 1 Pont sat at \nNumber 5— and he felt prepared to share with them or \nwith Monsieur Sixte on his right, if they found them- \nselves faced with too big a bank. \n\nAt Number 8 was the Maharajah of a small Indian \nstate, probably with all his wartime sterling balances to \nplay with. Bond's experience told him that few of the \nAsiatic races were courageous gamblers, even the much- \nvaunted Chinese being inclined to lose heart if the going \nwas bad. But the Maharajah would probably stay late in \nthe game and stand some heavy losses if they were \ngradual. \n\nNumber 10 was a prosperous-looking young Italian, \nSignor Tomelli, who possibly had plenty of money from \nrack-rents in Milan and would probably play a dashing \nand foolish game. He might lose his temper and make a \nscene. \n\nBond had just finished his sketchy summing-up of the \nplayers when Le Chiffre, with the silence and economy \nof movement of a big fish, came through the opening in \nthe brass rail and, with a cold smile of welcome for the \ntable, took his place directly opposite Bond in the \nBanker's chair. \n\nWith the same economy of movement, he cut the \nthick slab of cards, which the croupier had placed on the \ntable squarely between his blunt relaxed hands. Then, as \n\n\n\n68 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nthe croupier fitted the six packs with one swift motion \ninto the metal and wooden shoe, Le Chiffre said \nsomething quietly to him. \n\n'Messieurs, mesdames, les jeux sont faits, Un banco \nde cinq cent mille.' And, as the Greek at Number 1 \ntapped the table in front of his fat pile of hundred-mille \nplaques: 'Le banco est fait.' \n\nLe Chiffre crouched over the shoe. He gave it a short \ndeliberate slap to settle the cards, the first of which \nshowed its semicircular pale pink tongue through the \nslanting aluminum mouth of the shoe. Then, with a \nthick white forefinger he pressed gently on the pink \ntongue and slipped out the first card six inches or a foot \ntowards the Greek on his right hand. Then he slipped \nout a card for himself, then another for the Greek, then \none more for himself. \n\nHe sat immobile, not touching his own cards. \n\nHe looked at the Greek's face. \n\nWith his flat wooden spatula, like a long bricklayer's \ntrowel, the croupier delicately lifted up the Greek's two \ncards and dropped them with a quick movement an \nextra few inches to the right so that they lay just before \nthe Greek's pale hairy hands, which lay inert like two \nwatchful pink crabs on the table. \n\nThe two pink crabs scuttled out together and the \nGreek gathered the cards into his wide left hand and \ncautiously bent his head so that he could see, in the \nshadow made by his cupped hand, the value of the \nbottom of the two cards. Then he slowly inserted the \nforefinger of his right hand and slipped the bottom card \nslightly sideways so that the value of the top card was \nalso just perceptible. \n\nHis face was quite impassive. He flattened out his left \nhand on the table and then withdrew it, leaving the two \npink cards face down before him, their secret \nunrevealed. \n\nThen he lifted his head and looked Le Chiffre in the \neye. \n\n\n\nTHE HIGH TABLE \n\n\n\n69 \n\n\n\n'Non,' said the Greek flatly. \n\nFrom the decision to stand on his two cards and not \nto ask for another, it was clear that the Greek had a five, \nor a six, or a seven. To be certain Of winning, the bank \nhad to reveal an eight or a nine. If the banker failed to \nshow either figure, he also had the right to take another \ncard which might or might not improve his count. \n\nLe Chiffre's hands were clasped in front of him, his \ntwo cards three or four inches away. With his right hand \nhe picked up the two cards and turned them face up- \nwards on the table with a faint snap. \n\nThey were a four and a five, an uhdef eatable natural \nnine. \n\nHe had won. \n\n'Neuf a la banque,' quietly said the croupier. With his \nspatula he faced the Greek's two cards, 'Et le sept,' he \nsaid unemotionally, lifting up gently the corpses of the \nseven and queen and slipping them through the wide slot \nin the table near his chair which leads into the big metal \ncanister to which all dead cards are consigned. Le \nChiffre's two cards followed them with the faint rattle \nwhich comes from the canister at the beginning of each \nsession before the discards have made a cushion over the \nmetal floor of their oubliette. \n\nThe Greek pushed forward five plaques of one \nhundred thousand, and the coupier added these to \nLe Chiffre's half-million plaque which lay in the centre \nof the table. From each bet the Casino takes a tiny per- \ncentage, the cagnotte; but it is usual at a big game for \nthe banker to subscribe this himself either in a pre- \narranged lump sum or by contributions at the end of \neach hand, so that the amount of the bank's stake can \nalways be a round figure. Le Chiffre had chosen the \nsecond course. \n\nThe croupier slipped some counters through the slot \nin the table which receives the cagnotte and announced \nquietly: \n\n'Un banco d'un million.' \n\n\n\n70 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\n'Suivi,' murmured the Greek, meaning that he exer- \ncised his right to follow up his lost bet. \n\nBond lit a cigarette and settled himself in his chair. \nThe long game was launched, and the sequence of these \ngestures and the reiteration of this subdued litany would \ncontinue until the end came and the players dispersed. \nThen the enigmatic cards would be burnt or defaced, a \nshroud would be draped over the table, and the grass- \ngreen baize battlefield would soak up the blood of its \nvictims and refresh itself. \n\nThe Greek, after taking a third card, could achieve no \nbetter than a four to the bank's seven. \n\n'Un banco dedeux millions,' said the coupier. \n\nThe players on Bond's left remained silent. \n\n'Banco,' said Bond. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11 \n\n■I \n\nMoment of Truth \n\n\n\nLe Chiffre looked incuriously at him, the whites \nof his eyes, which showed all round the irises, lending \nsomething impassive and doll-like to his gaze. \n\nHe slowly removed one thick hand from the table and \nslipped it into the pocket of his dinner-jacket. The hand \ncame out holding a small metal cylinder with a cap \nwhich Le Chiffre unscrewed. He inserted the nozzle of \nthe cylinder, with an obscene deliberation, twice into \neach black nostril in turn, and luxuriously inhaled the \nbenzedrine vapour. \n\nUnhurriedly he pocketed the inhaler; then his hand \ncame quickly back, above the level of . the table and gave \nthe shoe its usual hard, sharp slap. \n\nDuring this offensive pantomime Bond had coldly \nheld the banker's gaze, taking in the wide expanse of \nwhite face surmounted by the short abrupt cliff of red- \ndish brown hair, the unsmiling wet red mouth, and the \n\n\n\n71 \n\n\n\n72 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nimpressive width of the shoulders, loosely draped in a \nmassively cut dinner-jacket. \n\nBut for the high-lights on the satin of the shawl-cut \nlapels, he might have been faced by the thick bust of a \nblack-fleeced Minotaur rising out of a green grass field. \n\nBond slipped a packet of notes on to the table without \ncounting them. If he lost, the croupier would extract \nwhat was necessary to cover the bet; but the easy gesture \nconveyed that Bond didn't expect to lose, and that this \nwas only a token display from the deep funds at Bond's \ndisposal. \n\nThe other players sensed a tension between the two \ngamblers, and there was a silence as Le Chiffre fingered \nthe four cards out of the shoe. \n\nThe croupier slipped Bond's two cards across to him \nwith the tip of his spatula. Bond, still with his eyes \nholding Le Chiffre's, reached his right hand out a few \ninches, glanced down very swiftly, then as he looked up \nagain impassively at Le Chiffre, with a disdainful \ngesture he tossed the cards face upwards on the table. \n\nThey were a four and a five-^an unbeatable nine. \n\nThere was a little gasp of envy from the table, and the \nplayers to the left of Bond exchanged rueful glances at \ntheir failure to accept the two-million-franc bet. \n\nWith the hint of a shrug, Le Chiffre slowly faced his \nown two cards and flicked them away with his finger- \nnail. They were two valueless knaves. \n\n'Le baccarat,' intoned the croupier as he spaded the \nthick chips over the table to Bond . \n\nBond slipped them into his right-hand pocket with the \nunused packet of notes. His face showed no emotion, \nbut he was pleased with the success of his first coup and \nwith the outcome of the silent clash of wills across the : \ntable. \n\nThe woman on his left, the American Mrs. Du Pont, \nturned to him with a wry smile. \n\n'I shouldn't have let it come to you,' she said. 'Di- \n\n\n\nMOMENT OFTRUTH \n\n\n\n73 \n\n\n\nrectly the cards were dealt I kicked myself. ' \n\n'It's only the beginning of the game\/ said Bond. 'You \nmay be right the next time you pass it. ' \n\nMr. Du Pont leant forward from the other side of his \nwife: 'If one could be right every hand, none of us \nwould be here, ' he said philosophically. \n\n'I would be,' his wife laughed. 'You don't think I do \nthis for pleasure.' \n\nAs the game went on, Bond looked over the spec- \ntators leaning on the high brass rail round the table. He \nsoon saw Le Chiffre's two gunmen. They stood behind \nand to either side of the banker. They looked respect- \nable enough, but not sufficiently a part of the game to \nbe unobtrusive, 1 \n\nThe one more or less behind Le Chiffre's right arm \nwas tall and funereal in his dinner-jacket. His face was \nwooden and grey, but his eyes flickered and gleamed \nlike a conjurer's. His whole long body was restless, and \nhis hands shifted often on the brass rail. Bond guessed \nthat he would kill without interest or concern for what \nhe killed, and that he would prefer strangling. He had \nsomething of Lennie in Of Mice and Men, but his \ninhumanity would not come from infantilism but from \ndrugs. Marihuana, decided Bond. \n\nThe other man looked like a Corsican shopkeeper. He \nwas short and very dark with a flat head covered with \nthickly greased hair. He seemed to be a cripple. A \nchunky Malacca cane with a rubber tip hung on a rail \nbeside him. He must have had permission to bring the \ncane into the Casino with him, reflected Bond, who \nknew that neither sticks nor any other objects were \nallowed in the rooms as a precaution against acts of \nviolence. He looked sleek and well fed. His mouth hung \nvacantly half open and revealed very bad teeth. He wore \na heavy black moustache, and the backs of his hands on \nthe rail were matted with black hair. Bond guessed that \nhair covered most of his squat body. Naked, Bond sup- \n\n\n\n74 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nposed, he would be an obscene object. \n\nThe game continued uneventfully, but with a slight \nbias against the bank. \n\nThe third coup is the 'sound barrier' at chemin-de-fer \nand baccarat. Your luck can defeat the first and second \ntests, but when the third deal comes along it most often \nspells disaster. Again and again at this point you find \nyourself being bounced back to earth. It was like that \nnow. Neither the bank nor any of the players seemed to \nbe able to get hot. But there was a steady and inexorable \nseepage against the bank, amounting after about two \nhours' play to ten million francs. Bond had no idea \nwhat profits Le Chiffre had made over the past two \ndays. He estimated them at five million and guessed that \nnow the banker's capital could not be more than twenty \nmillion. \n\nIn fact, Le Chiffre had lost heavily all that afternoon. \nAt this moment he only had ten million left. \n\nBond, on the other hand, by one o'clock in the morn- \ning, had; won four million, bringing his resources up to \ntwenty-eight million. \n\nBond was cautiously pleased. Le Chiffre showed no \ntrace of emotion. He continued to play like an \nautomaton, never speaking except when he gave in- \nstructions in a low aside to the croupier at the opening \nof each new bank. \n\nOutside the pool of silence round the high table, there \nwas the constant hum of the other tables, chemin-de- - \nfer, roulette, and trente-et-quarante, interspersed with \nthe clear calls of the croupiers and occasional bursts of \nlaughter or gasps of excitement from different corners \nof the huge salle. \n\nIn the background there thudded always the hidden \nmetronome of the Casino, ticking up its little treasure of \none-per-cents with each spin of a wheel and each turn of \na card — a pulsing fat-cat with a zero for a heart. \n\nIt was at ten minutes past one by Bond's watch that, \n\n\n\nMOMENT OF TRUTH \n\n\n\n75 \n\n\n\nat the high table, the\" whole pattern of play suddenly \naltered. \n\nThe Greek at Number 1 was still having a bad time. \nHe had lost the first coup of half a million francs and \nthe second. He passed the third time, leaving a bank of \ntwo millions. Carmel Delane at Number 2 refused it. So \ndid Lady Danvers at Number 3. \n\nThe Du Ponts looked at each other. \n\n'Banco,' said Mrs. Du Pont, and promptly lost to the \nbanker's natural eight. \n\n'Un banco de quatre millions, ' said the croupier. \n\n'Banco,' said Bond, pushing out a wad of notes. \n\nAgain he fixed Le Chiffre with his eye. Again he gave \nonly a cursory look at his two cards . \n\n'No,' he said. He held a marginal five. The position \nwas dangerous. \n\nLe Chiffre turned up a knave and a four. He gave the \nshoe another slap. He drew a three. \n\n'Sept a la banque,' said the croupier, 'et cinq,' he \nadded as he tipped Bond's losing cards face upwards. \nHe raked over Bond's money, extracted four million \nfrancs and returned the remainder to Bond. \n\n'Un banco de huit millions.' \n\n'Suivi,' said Bond. \n\nAnd lost again, to a natural nine. \n\nIn two coups he had lost twelve million francs. By \nscrapping the barrel, he had just sixteen million francs \nleft,' exactly the amount of the next banco. \n\nSuddenly Bond felt the sweat on his palms. Like snow \nin sunshine his capital had melted. With the covetous \ndeliberation of the winning gambler, Le Chiffre was \ntapping a light tattoo on the table with his right hand. \nBond looked across into the eyes of murky basalt. They \nheld an ironical question. 'Do you want the full treat- \nment?' they seemed to ask. \n\n'Suivi,' Bond said softly. \n\nHe took some notes and plaques out of his right-hand \n\n\n\n76 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\npocket and the entire stack of notes out of his left and \npushed them forward. There was no hint in his \nmovements that this would be his last stake. \n\nHis mouth felt suddenly as dry as flock wall-paper. \nHe looked up and saw Vesper and Felix Leiter standing \nwhere the gunman with the stick had stood. He did not \nknow how long they had been standing there. Leiter \nlooked faintly worried, but Vesper smiled en- ' \ncouragement at him.. \n\nHe heard a faint rattle on the rail behind him and \nturned his head. The battery of bad teeth under the \nblack moustache gaped vacantly back at him. \n\n'Le jeu est fait,' said the croupier, and the two cards \ncame slithering towards him over the green baize — a \ngreen baize which was no longer smooth, but thick now, \nand furry and almost choking^ its colour as livid as the \ngrass on a fresh tomb. \n\nThe light from the broad satin-lined shades which had \nseemed so welcoming now seemed to take the colour out \nof his hand as he glanced at the cards. Then he looked \nagain. \n\nIt was nearly as bad as it could have been — the king of \nhearts and an ace, the ace of spades. It squinted up at \nhim like a black widow spider. \n\n'A card.' He still kept all emotion out of his voice. \n\nLe Chiffre faced his own two cards. He had a queen \nand a black five. He looked at Bond and pressed out \nanother card with a wide forefinger. The table was ab- \nsolutely silent. He faced it and flicked it away. The \ncroupier lifted it delicately with his spatula and slipped \nit over to Bond. It was a good card, the five of hearts, \nbut to Bond it was a difficult fingerprint in dried blood. \nHe now had a count of six and Le Chiffre a count of \nfive, but the banker having a five and giving a five, \nwould and must draw another card and try and improve \nwith a one, two, three, or four. Drawing any other card \nhe would be defeated. \n\n\n\nMOMENTOFTRUTH \n\n\n\n77 \n\n\n\nThe odds were on Bond's side, but now it was Le \nChiffre who looked across into Bond's eyes and hardly \nglanced at the card as he flicked it face upwards on the \ntable. \n\nIt was, unnecessarily, the best, a four, giving the bank \na count of nine. He had won, almost slowing up. \nBond was beaten and cleaned out. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12 \n\nThe Deadly Tube \n\n\n\nBond sat silent, frozen with defeat. He opened \nhis wide black case and took out a cigarette. He snapped \nopen the tiny jaws of the Ronson and lit the cigarette \nand put the lighter back on the table. He took a deep \nlungful of smoke and expelled it between his teeth with a \nfaint hiss. \n\nWhat now? Back to the hotel and bed, avoiding the \ncommiserating eyes of Mathis and Leiter and Vesper: \nBack to the telephone call to London, and then \ntomorrow the plane home, the taxi up to Regent's Park, \nthe walk up the .stairs and along the corridor, and M.'s \ncold face across the table, his forced sympathy, his \n'Better luck next time'; and, of course, there couldn't be \none, not another.chance like this. \n\nHe looked round the table and up at the spectators. \nFew were looking at him. They were waiting while the \ncroupier counted the money and piled up the chips in a \nneat stack in front of the banker, waiting to see if \nanyone would conceivably challenge this huge bank of \n\n\n\n78 \n\n\n\nTHE DEADLY TUBE \n\n\n\n79 \n\n\n\nthirty-two million francs, this wonderful run of \nbanker's luck. \n\nLeiter had vanished, not wishing to look Bond in the \neye after the knock-out, he supposed. Yet Vesper \nlooked curiously unmoved, she gave him a smile of en- \ncouragement. But then, Bond reflected, she knew \nnothing of the game. Had no notion, probably, of the \nbitterness of his defeat. \n\nThe huissier was coming towards Bond inside the rail. \nHe stopped beside him. Bent over him. Placed a squat \nenvelope beside Bond on the table. It was as thick as a \ndictionary. Said something about the caisse. Moved \naway again. \n\nBond's heart thumped. He took the heavy \nanonymous envelope below the level of the table and slit \nit open with his thumbnail, noticing that the gum was \nstill wet on the flap. \n\nUnbelieving and yet knowing it was true, he felt the \nbroad wads of notes. He slipped them into his pockets, \nretaining the half-sheet of notepaper which was pinned \nto the topmost of them. He glanced at it in the shadow \nbelow the table. There was one line of writing in ink: \n'Marshall Aid. Thirty-two million francs. With the \ncompliments of the U.S.A.' \n\nBond swallowed. He looked over towards Vesper. \nFelix Leiter was again standing beside her. He grinned \nslightly, and Bond smiled back and raised his hand from \nthe table in a small gesture of benediction. Then he set \nhis mind to sweeping away all traces of the sense of \ncomplete defeat which had swamped him a few minutes \nbefore. This was a reprieve, but only a reprieve. There \ncould be no more miracles. This time he had to win— if \nLe Chif fre had not already made his fifty million — if he \nwas going to go on! \n\nThe croupier had completed his task of computing the \ncagnotte, changing Bond's notes into plaques, and \nmaking a pile of the giant stake in the middle of the \ntable. \n\n\n\n80 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nThere lay thirty-two thousand pounds. Perhaps, \nthought Bond, Le Chiffre needed just one more coup, \neven a minor one of a few million francs, to achieve his \nobject. Then he would have made his fifty million \nfrancs and would leave the table. By tomorrow his \ndeficits would be covered and his position secure. \n. He showed no signs of moving, and Bond guessed \nwith relief that somehow he must have overestimated Le \nChiffre' s resources. \n\nThen the only hope, thought Bond, was to stamp on \nhim how. Not to share the bank with the table, or to \ntake some minor r part of it, but to go the whole hog. \nThis would really jolt Le Chiffre. He would hate to see \nmore than ten or fifteen million of the stake covered, \nand he could not possibly expect anyone to banco the \nentire thirty-two millions. He might not know that Bond \nhad been cleaned out, but he must imagine that Bond \nhad by now only small reserves. He could not know of \nthe contents of the envelope. If he did, he would \nprobably withdraw the bank and start all over again on \nthe wearisome journey up from the five hundred franc \nopening bet. \n\nThe analysis was right. ! \nLe Chiffre needed another eight million. \nAt last he nodded. \n'Un banco de trente-deux millions.' \nThe croupier's voice rang out. A silence built itself up \nround the table. \n\n. 'Un banco de trente-deux millions. ' \/ \n\nIn a louder, prouder voice the chef de partie took up \nthe cry, hoping to draw big money away from the neigh- \nbouring chemin-de-fer tables. Besides, this was won- \nderful publicity. The stake had only once been reached \nin the history of baccarat — at Deauville in 1950. The, \nrival Casino de la ForSt at Le Touquet had never got \nnear it. \n\nIt was then that Bond leant slightly forward. \n'Suivi,' he said quietly. \n\n\n\nTHEDEADLYTUBE \n\n\n\nThere was an excited buzz round the table. The word \nran through the Casino. People crowded in. Thirty-two \nmillion! For most of them it was more than they had \nearned all their lives. It was their savings and the savings \nof their families. It was, literally, a small fortune. \n\nOne of the Casino directors consulted with the chef de \npartie. The chef de partie turned apologetically to Bond. \n\n'Excusezmoi, monsieur. La mise?' \n,. It was an indication that Bond really must show he \nhad the money to coyer the bet. They knew, of course, \nthat he was a very wealthy man, but after all, thirty-two \nmillions! And it sometimes happened that desperate \npeople would bet without a sou in the world and cheer- \nfully go to prison if they lost. \n\n'Mes excuses, Monsieur Bond,' added the chef de \npartie obsequiously. \n\nIt was when Bond shovelled the great wad of notes \nout on to the table and the croupier busied himself with \nthe task of counting the pinned sheaves of ten thousand \nfranc notes, the largest denomination issued in France, \nthat he caught a swift exchange of glances between Le \nChiffre and the gunman standing directly behind Bond. \n\nImmediately he felt something hard press into the \nbase of his spine, right into the cleft between his two \nbuttocks on the padded chair. \n\nAt the same time a thick voice speaking southern \nFrench said softly, urgently, just behind his right ear: \n\n'This is a gun, monsieur. It is absolutely silent. It can \nblow the base of your spine off without a sound. You \nwill appear to have fainted. I shall be gone. Withdraw \nyour bet before I count ten. If you call for help I shall \nfire.' \n\nThe voice Was confident. Bond believed it. These \npeople had shown they would unhesitatingly go the \nlimit. The thick walking stick was explained. Bond knew \nthe type of gun. The barrel a series of soft rubber baffles \nwhich absorbed the detonation, but allowed the passage \nof the bullet. They had been invented and used in the \n\n\n\nv. \n\n\n\n82 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nwar for assassinations. Bond had tested them himself. \n'Un,' said the voice. \n\nBond turned his head. There was the man, leaning \nforward close behind him, smiling broadly under his \nblack moustache as if he were wishing Bond luck, com- \npletely secure in the noise and the crowd. \n\nThe discoloured teeth came together. 'Deux,' said the \ngrinning mouth. \n\nBond looked across. Le Chiffre was watching him. \nHis eyes glittered back at Bond. His mouth was open, \nand he was breathing fast. He was waiting, waiting for \nBond's hand to gesture to the croupier, or else for Bond \nsuddenly to slump backwards in his chair, his face \ngrimacing with a scream. \n\n'Trois.' \n\nBond looked over at Vesper and Felix Leiter. They \nwere smiling and talking to each other. The fools. \nWhere was Mathis? Where were those famous men of \nhis? \n\n'Quatre.' \n\nAnd the other spectators. This crowd of jabbering \nidiots. Couldn't someone see what was happening? The \nchef de partie, the croupier, the huissier? \n\n'Cinq.' \n\nThe croupier was tidying up the pile of notes. The \nchef de partie bowed smilingly towards Bond. Directly \nthe stake was in order he would announce, 'Le jeux est \nfait,' and the gun would fire whether the gunman had \nreached ten or not. \n\n'Six.' \n\nBond decided. It was a chance. He carefully moved \nhis hands to the edge of the table, gripped it, edged his \nbuttocks right back, feeling the sharp gun-sight grind \ninto his coccyx. \n\n'Sept.' \n\nThe chef de partie turned to Le Chiffre with his \neyebrows lifted, waiting for the banker's nod that he \nwas ready to play. \n\n\n\nTHE DEADLYTUBE \n\n\n\n83 \n\n\n\nSuddenly Bond heaved backwards with all his \nstrength. His momentum tipped the crossbar of the \nchair-back down so quickly that it cracked across the \nMalacca tube and wrenched it from the gunman's hand \nbefore he could pull the trigger. \n\nBond went head-over-heels on to the ground amongst \nthe spectators' feet, his legs in the air. The back of the \nchair splintered with the sharp crack. There were cries \nof dismay. The spectators cringed away and then, \nreassured, clustered back. Hands helped him to his feet \nand brushed him down. The huissier bustled up with the \nchef de partie. At all costs a scandal must be avoided. \n\nBond held on to the brass rail. He looked confused \nand embarrassed. He brushed his hand across his \nforehead. 'A momentary faintness,' he said. 'It is \nnothing — the excitement, the heat. ' \n\nThere were expressions of sympathy. Naturally, with \nthis tremendous game. Would Monsieur prefer to with- \ndraw, to lie down, to go home? Should a doctor be \nfetched? \n\nBond shook his head. He was perfectly all right now. \nHis excuses to the table. To the banker also. \n\nA new chair was brought and he sat down. He looked \nacross at Le Chiffre. Through his relief at being alive, \nhe felt a moment of triumph at what he saw— some fear \nin the fat, pale face. \n\nThere was a buzz of speculation round the table. \nBond's neighbours on both sides of him bent forward \nand spokefsolicitously about the heat and the lateness of \nthe hour and the smoke and the lack of ain * \nV Bond replied politely. He turned to examine the \ncrowd behind him. There was no trace of the gunman, \nbut the huissier was looking for someone to claim the \nMalacca stick. It seemed undamaged. But it no longer \ncarried a rubber tip. Bond beckoned to him. \n\n'If you will give it to that gentleman over there' — he \nindicated Felix Leiter— 'he will return it. It belongs to \nan acquaintance of his.' \n\n\n\n84 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nThe huissier bowed. \n\nBond grimly reflected that a short examination would \nreveal to Leiter why he had made such an embarrassing \npublic display of himself. \n\nHe turned back to the table and tapped the green \ncloth in front of him to show that he was ready. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13 \n\n\n\n'A Whisper of Love, \nA Whisper of Hate' \n\n\n\n'La Partie continue,' announced the chef im- \npressively, 'tin banco de trente-deux millions. ' ' \n\nThe spectators craned forward. Le Chiffre hit the \nshoe with a flat-handed slap that made it rattle. As an \nafterthought he took out his benzedrine inhaler and \nsucked the vapour up his nose. '■<•\"■• \n\n'Filthy brute,' said Mrs. Du Pont on Bond's left. \n\nBond's mind was clear again. By a miracle he had sur- \nvived a devastating wound. He could feel his armpits \nstill wet with the fear of it. But the success of his gambit \nwith the chair had wiped out all memories of the dread- \nful valley of defeat through which he had just passed. \n\nHe had made a fool of himself. The game had been \ninterrupted for at least ten minutes, a delay unheard of • \nin a respectable casino, but now cards were waiting for \nhim in the shoe. They must not fail him. He felt his \nheart lift at the prospect of what was to come, \n\nIt was two o'clock in the morning. Apart from the \nthick crowd round the big game, play was still going on \n\n85 \n\n\n\n86 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nat three of the chemin-de-fer games and at the same \nnumber of roulette tables. \n\nIn the silence round his own table, Bond suddenly \nheard a distant croupier intone: 'Neuf . Le rouge gagne, \nimpair et manque.' \n\nWas this an omen for him or for Le Chiffre? \n\nThe two cards slithered towards him across the green \nsea. \n\nLike an octopus under a rock, Le Chiffre watched \nhim from the other side of the table. \n\nBond reached out a steady right hand and drew the \ncards towards him. Would it be the lift of the heart \nwhich a nine brings, or an eight brings? \n\nHe fanned the two cards under the curtain of his \nhand. The. muscles of his jaw rippled as he clenched his \nteeth. His whole body stiffened in a reflex of self- \ndefence. \n\nHe had two queens, two red queens. \n\nThey looked rougishly back at him from the shadows. \nThey were the worst. They were nothing. Zero. Bac- \ncarat. \n\n'A card, ' said Bond, fighting to keep hopelessness out \nof his voice. He felt Le Chiffre' s eyes boring into his \nbrain. \n\nThe banker slowly turned his own two cards face up. \n\nHe had a count of three — a king and a black three. \n\nBond softly exhaled a cloud of tobacco smoke. He \nstill had a chance. Now he was really faced with the \nmoment of truth. Le Chiffre slapped the shoe, slipped \nout a card, Bond's card, Bond's fate, and slowly turned \nit face up. \n\nIt was a nine, a wonderful nine of hearts — the card \nknown in gipsy magic as 'a whisper of love, a whisper of \nhate,' the card that meant almost certain victory for \nBond. \n\nThe croupier slipped it delicately across. To \nLe Chiffre it meant nothing. Bond might have had a \none, in which case he now had ten points, or nothing, or \n\n\n\n'A WHISPER OF LOVE, A WHISPER OF HATE' 87 \n\nbaccarat, as it is called. Or he might have had a two, \nthree, four, or even five. In which case, with nine, his \nmaximum count would be four. \n\nHolding a three and giving a nine is one of the moot \nsituations at the game. The odds are so nearly divided \nbetween to draw or not to draw. Bond let the banker \nsweat it out. Since his nine could only be equalled by the \nbanker drawing a six, he would normally have shown \nhis count if it had been a friendly game. \n\nBond's cards lay on the table before him, the two im- \npersonal pale pink-patterned backs and the faced nine \nof hearts. To Le Chiffre the nine might be telling the > \ntruth or many variations of lies. \n\nThe whole secret lay in the reverse of the two pink \nbacks where the pair of queens kissed the green cloth. \n\nThe sweat was running down either side of the \nbanker's beaky nose. His thick tongue came out slyly \nand licked a drop out of the corner of his red gash of a \nmouth. He looked at Bond's cards, and then at his own, \nand then back at Bond's. \n\nThen his whole body shrugged and he slipped out a \ncard for himself from the lisping shoe. \n\nHe faced it. The table craned. It was a wonderful \ncard, a five. \n\n'Huit a la banque,' said the croupier. > \n\nAs Bond sat silent, Le Chiffre suddenly grinned \nwolfishly. He must have won. i \n\nThe croupier's spatula reached almost apologetically \nacross the table. There was not a man at the table who \ndid not believe Bond was defeated. \n\nThe spatula flicked the two pink cards over on their \nbacks. The gay red queens smiled up at the lights. \n\n'Etleneuf.' \n\nA great gasp went up round the table, and then a hub- \nbub of talk. \n\nBond's eyes were on Le Chiffre. The big man fell \nback in his chair as if slugged above the heart. His \nmouth opened and shut once or twice in protest, and \n\n\n\n88 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nhis right hand felt at his throat. Then he rocked back. \nHis lips were grey. \n\nAs the huge stack of plaques was shunted across the \ntable to Bond the banker reached into an inner pocket \nof his jacket and threw a wad of notes on to the table. \n\nThe croupier riffled through them. \n\n'Un banco de dix millions,' he announced. He \nslapped down their equivalent in ten plaques of a \nmillion each. \n\nThis is the kill, thought Bond. This man has reached \nthe point of no return. This is the last of his capital. He \nhas come to where I stood an hour ago, and he is \nmaking the last gesture that I made. But if this man \nloses there is no one to come to his aid, no miracle to \nhelp him. \n\nBond sat back arid lit a cigarette. On a small table \nbeside him half a bottle of Clicquot and a glass had \nmaterialized. Without asking who the benefactor was, \nBond filled the glass to the brim and drank it down in \ntwo long draughts. \n\nThen he leant back with his arms curled forward on \nthe table in front of him like the arms of a wrestler \nseeking a hold at the opening of a bout of ju-jitsu. \n\nThe players on his left remained silent. \n\n'Banco,' he said, speaking straight at Le Chiffre. \n\nOnce more the two cards were borne over to him, and \nthis time the croupier slipped them into the green lagoon \nbetween the outstretched arms. \n\nBond curled his right hand in, glanced briefly down \nand flipped the cards face up into the middle of the \ntable. \n\n' Le neuf , ' said the croupier. \n\nLe Chiffre was gazing down at his own two black \nkings. \n\n'Et le baccarat,' and the croupier eased across the \ntable the fat tide of plaques. \n\nLe Chiffre watched them go to join the serried \nmillions in the shadow of Bond's left arm; then he stood \n\n\n\n'A WHISPER OF LOVE, A WHISPER OF HATE' \n\n\n\n89 \n\n\n\nup slowly, and without a word he brushed past the \nplayers to the break in the rail. He unhooked the velvet- \ncovered chain and let it fall. The spectators opened a \nway for him. They looked at him curiously and rather \nfearfully as if he carried the smell of death on him. Then \nhe vanished from Bond's sight. \n\nBond stood up. He took a hundred-mille plaque from \nthe stacks beside him and slipped it across the table to \nthe chef de partie. He cut short the effusive thanks and \nasked the croupier to have his winnings carried to the \ncaisse. The other players were leaving their seats. With \nno banker, there could be no game, and by now it was \nhalf-past two. He exchanged some pleasant words with \nhis neighbours to right and left and then ducked under \nthe rail to where Vesper and Felix Leiter were waiting \nfor him. \n\nTogether they walked over to the caisse. Bond was \ninvited to come into the private office of the Casino \ndirectors. On the desk lay his huge pile of chips. He \nadded the contents of his pockets to it. \n\nIn all there was over seventy million francs. \n\nBond took Felix Leiter's money in notes and took a \ncheque to cash on the Credit Lyonnais for the remaining \nforty-odd million. He was congratulated warmly on his \nwinnings. The directors hoped that he would be playing \nagain that evening. \n\nBond gave an evasive reply. He walked over to the bar \nand handed Leiter's money to him. For a few minutes \nthey discussed the game over a bottle of champagne. \nLeiter took a .45 bullet out of his pocket and placed it \non the table. \n\n'I gave the gun to Mathis,' he said. 'He's taken it \naway. He Was as puzzled as we were by the spill you \ntook. He was standing at the back of the crowd with one \nof his men when it happened. The gunman got away \nwithout difficulty. You can imagine how they kicked \nthemselves when they saw the gun. Mathis gave me this \nbullet to show you what you escaped. The nose had been \n\n\n\n90 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\ncut with a dum-dum cross. You'd have been in a terrible \nmess. But they can't tie it on to Le Chiffre. The man \ncame in alone. They've got the form he filled up to get \nhis entrance card. Of course, it'll all be phony. He got \npermission to bring the stick in with him. He had a cer- \ntificate for a war-wound pension. These people certainly \nget themselves well organized. They've got his prints \nand they're on the Belinograph to Paris, so we may hear \nmore about him in the morning.' Felix Leiter tapped out \nanother cigarette. 'Anyway, all's well that ends well. \nYou certainly took Le Chiffre for a ride at the end, \nthough we had some bad moments. I expect you did \ntoo.' \n\nBond smiled. 'That envelope was the most wonderful \nthing that ever happened to me. I thought I was really \nfinished. It wasn't at all a pleasant feeling. Talk about a \nfriend in need. One day I'll try and return the com- \npliment.' \n\nHe rose. 'I'll just go over to the hotel and put this \naway,' he said, tapping his pocket. 'I don't like wan- \ndering around with Le Chiffre' s death warrant on me. \nHe might get ideas. Then I'd like to celebrate a bit. \nWhat do you think?' \n\nHe turned to Vesper. She had hardly said a word since \nthe end of the game. \n\n'Shall we have a glass of champagne in the night club \nbefore we go to bed? It's called the Roi Galant. You get \nto it through the public rooms. It looks quite cheerful. ' \n\nT think I'd love to,' said Vesper. 'I'll tidy up while \nyou put your winnings away. I'll meet you in the en- \ntrance hall.' \n\n'What about you, Felix?' Bond hoped he could be \nalone with Vesper. \n\nLeiter looked at him and read his mind. \n\n'I'd rather take a little rest before breakfast,' he said. \n'It's been quite a day, and I expect Paris will want me to \ndo a bit of mopping-up tomorrow. There are several \nloose ends you won't have to worry about. I shall. I'll \n\n\n\n'A WHISPER OF LOVE, A WHISPER OF HATE' 91 \n\nwalk over to the hotel with you. Might as well convoy \nthe treasure ship right into port.' \n\nThey strolled over through the shadows cast hy the \nfull moon. Both had their hands on their guns. It was \nthree o'clock in the morning, but there were several \npeople about and the courtyard of the Casino was still \nlined with motorcars. \n\nThe short walk was uneventful. \n\nAt the hotel, Leiter insisted on accompanying Bond \nto his room. It was as Bond had left it six hours before. \n\n'No reception committee,' observed Leiter, 'but I \nwouldn't put it past them to try a last throw. Do you \nthink I ought to stay up and keep you two company? ' \n\n'You get your sleep,' said Bond. 'Don't worry about \nus. They won't be interested in me without the money \nand I've got an idea for looking after that. Thanks for \nall you've done. I hope we get on a job again one day. ' \n\n'Suits me,' said Leiter, 'so long as you can draw a \nnine when it's needed — and bring Vesper along with \nyou, ' he added dryly. He went out and closed the door. \n\nBond turned back to the friendliness of his room. \n\nAfter the crowded arena of the big table and the ner- \nvous strain of the three hours' play, he was glad to be \nalone for a moment and to be welcomed by his pyjamas \non the bed and his hairbrushes on the dressing-table. He \nwent into the bathroom and dashed cold water over his \nface and gargled with a sharp mouthwash. He felt the \nbruises on the back of his head and on his right \nshoulder. He reflected cheerfully how narrowly he had \ntwice that day escaped being murdered. Would he have \nto sit up all that night and wait for them to come again, \nor was Le Chiffre even now on his way to Le Havre or \nBordeaux to pick up a boat for some corner of the world \nwhere he could escape the eyes and guns of SMERSH? \n\nBond shrugged his shoulders. Sufficient unto that day \nhad been its evil. He gazed for a moment into the mirror \nand wondered about Vesper's morals. He wanted her \ncold and arrogant body. He wanted to see tears and \n\n\n\n92 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\ndesire in her remote blue eyes and to take the ropes of \nher black hair in his hands and bend.her long body back \nunder his. Bond's eyes narrowed, and his face in the \nmirror looked back at him with hunger. \n\nHe turned away and took out of his pocket the cheque \nfor forty million francs. He folded this very small. Then \nhe opened the door and looked up and down the \ncorridor. He left the door wide open and with his ears \ncocked for footsteps or the sound of the lift, he set to \nwork with a small screwdriver. \n\nFive minutes later he gave a last-minute survey to his \nhandiwork, put some fresh cigarettes in his case, closed \nand locked the door, and went off down the corridor \nand across the hall and out into the moonlight. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14 \n\n'La Vie en Rose?' \n\n\n\nThe entrance to the Roi Galant was a seven-foot \ngolden picture-frame which had once, perhaps, enclosed \nthe vast portrait of a noble European. It was in a \ndiscreet corner of the 'kitchen' — the public roulette and \nboule room, where several tables were still busy. As \nBond took Vesper's arm and led her over the gilded \nstep, he fought back a hankering to borrow some money \nfrom the caisse and plaster maximums over the nearest \ntable. But he knew that this would be a brash and cheap \ngesture 'pour Spater la bourgeoisie. ' Whether he won or \nlost, it would be a kick in the teeth to the luck which had \nbeen given him. \n\nThe night club was small and dark, lit only by candles \nin gilded candelabra whose warm light was repeated in \nwall mirrors set in more gold picture-frames. The walls \nwere covered in dark red satin, and the chairs and \nbanquettes in matching red plush. In the far corner, a \ntrio, consisting of a piano, an electric guitar, and \ndrums, was playing 'La Vie en Rose' with muted sweet- \n\n\n\n93 \n\n\n\n94 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nness. Seduction dripped on the quietly throbbing air. It \nseemed to Bond that every couple must be touching with \npassion under the tables. \n\nThey were given a corner table near the door. Bond \nordered a bottle of Veuve Clicquot and scrambled eggs \nand bacon. \n\nThey sat for a time listening to the music, and then \nBond turned to Vesper: 'It's wonderful sitting here with \nyou and knowing the job's finished. It's a lovely end to \nthe day — the prize-giving.' \n\nHe expected her to smile. She said, 'Yes, isn't it?' in a \nrather brittle voice. She seemed to be listening carefully \nto the music. One elbow rested on the table, and her \nhand supported her chin, but on the back of her hand \nand not on the palm; and Bond noticed that her \nknuckles showed white as if her fist was tightly \nclenched. \n\nBetween the thumb and first two fingers of her right \nhand she held one of Bond's cigarettes, as an artist \nholds a crayon; and though she smoked with composure \nshe tapped the cigarette occasionally into an ashtray \nwhen the cigarette had no ash. \n\nBond noticed these small things because he felt in- \ntensely aware of her and because he wanted to draw her \ninto his own feeling of warmth and relaxed sensuality. \nBut he accepted her reserve. He thought it came from a \ndesire to protect herself from him, or else it was her \nreaction to his coolness to her earlier in the evening, his \ndeliberate coolness, which he knew had been taken as a \nrebuff. \n\nHe was patient. He drank champagne and talked a \nlittle about the happenings of the day and about the per- \nsonalities of Mathis and Leiter and about the possible \nconsequences for Le Chiffre. He was discreet, and he \nonly talked about the aspects of the case on which she \nmust have been briefed by London. \n\nShe answered perfunctorily'. She said that, of course, \nthey had picked out the two gunmen, but had thought \n\n\n\n'LA VIE EN ROSE?' \n\n\n\n95 \n\n\n\nnothing of it when the man with the stick had gone to \nstand behind Bond's chair. They could not believe that \nanything would be attempted in the Casino itself. Di- \nrectly Bond and Leiter had left to walk over to the hotel, \nshe had telephoned Paris and told M.'s representative of \nthe result of the game. She had had to speak guardedly, \nand the agent had rung off without comment. She had \nbeen told to do this whatever the result. M. had asked \nfor the information to be passed on to him personally at \nany time of the day or night. \n\nThis was all she said. She sipped at her champagne \nand rarely glanced at Bond. She didn't smile. Bond felt \nfrustrated. He drank a lot of champagne and ordered \nanother bottle. The scrambled eggs came, and they ate \nin silence. \n\nAt four o'clock Bond was about to call for the bill \nwhen the maltre d'hStel appeared at their table and \ninquired for Miss Lynd. He handed her a note which she \ntook and read hastily. \n\n'Oh, it's only Mathis,' she said. 'He says would T \ncome to the entrance hall. He's got a message for you. \nPerhaps he's not in evening clothes or something. I \nWon't be a minute. Then perhaps we could go home.' \n\nShe gave him a strained smile. 'I'm afraid I don't feel \nvery good company this evening. It's been rather a \nnerve-racking day, I'm so sorry.' \n\nBond made a perfunctory reply and rose, pushing \nback the table. 'I'll get the bill,' he said, and watched \nher take the few steps to the entrance. \n\nHe sat down and lit a cigarette. He felt flat. He sud- \ndenly realized that he was tired. The stuffiness of the \nroom hit him as it had hit him in the Casino in the early \nhours of the previous day. He called for the bill and \ntook a last mouthful of champagne. It tasted bitter, as \nthe first glass too many always does. He would have \nliked to see Mathis' s cheerful face and hear his news, \nperhaps even a word of congratulation. \n\nSuddenly the note to Vesper seemed odd to him. It \n\n\n\n96 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nwas not the way Mathis would do things. He would have \nasked them both to join him at the bar of the Casino, or \nhe would have joined them in the night club, whatever \nhis clothes. They would have laughed together, and \nMathis would have been excited. He had much to tell \nBond, more than Bond had to tell him: the arrest of the \nBulgarian, who had probably talked some more; the \nchase after the man with the stick; Le Chiffre's \nmovements when he left the Casino. \n\nBond shook himself. He hastily paid the bill, not \nwaiting for the change. He pushed back his table and \nwalked quickly through the entrance without \nacknowledging the good-nights of the maltre d'hdtel \nand the doorman. \n\nHe hurried through the gaming-room and looked \ncarefully up and down the long entrance hall. He cursed \nand quickened his step. There were only one or two of- \nficials and two or three men and women in evening \nclothes getting their things at the vestiaire. \n\nNo Vesper. No Mathis. \n\nHe was almost running. He got to the entrance and \nlooked along the steps to the left and right down and \namongst the few remaining cars. \n\nThe commissionaire came towards him. \n\n'A taxi, monsieur?' ;■ \n\nBond waved him aside and started down the steps, his \neyes staring into the shadows, the night air cold on his \nsweating temples. \n\nHe was halfway down when he heard a faint cry, then \nthe slam of a door away to the right. With a harsh growl \nand stutter from the exhaust a beetle-browed Citroen \nshot out of the shadows into the light of the moon, its \nfront- wheel drive dry-skidding through the loose \npebbles of the forecourt. \n\nIts tail rocked on its soft springs as if a violent \nstruggle was taking place on the back seat. \n\nWith a snarl it raced out to the wide entrance gate in a \nspray of gravel. A small black- object shot out of an \n\n\n\n'LA VIE EN ROSE?' \n\n\n\n97 \n\n\n\nopen rear window and thudded into a flower-bed. There \nwas a scream of tortured rubber as the tyres caught the \nboulevard in a harsh left-handed turn, the deafening \necho of a Citroen' s exhaust in second gear, a crash into \ntop, then a swiftly diminishing crackle as the car hared \noff between the shops on the main street towards the \ncoast-road. \n\nBond knew he would find Vesper's evening bag \namong the flowers. \n\nHe ran back with it across the gravel to the brightly lit \nsteps and scrabbled through its contents while the com- \nmissionaire hovered round him. \n\nThe crumpled note was there amongst the usual \nfeminine baggage: \n\n'Can you come out to the entrance hall for a \nmoment? I have news for your companion. \n\nRene Mathis.' \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15 \n\n\n\nBlack Hare and Grey Hound \n\n\n\nIt was the crudest possible forgery. \n\nBond leapt for the Bentley, blessing the impulse \n, which had made him drive it over after dinner. With the \nchoke full out the engine answered at once to the starter, \nand the roar drowned the faltering words of the com- \nmissionaire who jumped aside as the rear wheels \nwhipped gravel at his piped trouser-legs. \n\nAs the car rocked to the left outside the gate, Bond \nruefully longed for the front-wheel drive and low chassis \nof the Citroen. Then he went fast through the gears and \nsettled himself for the pursuit, briefly savouring the \necho of the huge exhaust as it came back at him from \neither side of the short main street through the town. \n\nSoon he was out on the coast-road, a broad highway \nthrough the sand-dunes which he knew from his morn- \ning's drive had an excellent surface and was well cat' s- \neyed on the bends. He pushed the revs up and up, \nhurrying the car to eighty then to . ninety, his huge \nMarchai headlights boring a safe white tunnel, nearly \n\n\n\n98 \n\n\n\nBLACK HARE AND GREY HOUND 99 \n\nhalf a mile long, between the walls of the night. \n\nHe knew the Citroen must have come this way. He \nhad heard the exhaust penetrate beyond the town, and a \nlittle dust still hung on the bends. He hoped soon to see \nthe distant shaft of its headlights. The night was still and \nclear. Only out at sea there must be a light summer mist, \nfor at intervals he could hear the foghorns lowing like \niron cattle down the coast. \n\nAs he drove, whipping the car faster and faster \nthrough the night, with the other half of his mind he \ncursed Vesper, and M. for having sent her on the job. \n\nThis was just what he had been afraid of. These \nblithering women who thought they could do a man's \nwork. Why the hell couldn't they stay at home and mind v \ntheir pots and pans and stick to their frocks and gossip \nand leave men's work to the men? And now for this to \nhappen to him, just when the job had come off so \nbeautifully: for Vesper to fall for an old trick like that \nand get herself snatched and probably held to ransom \nlike some bloody heroine in a strip cartoon. The silly \nbitch. \n\n-Bond boiled at the thought of the fix he was in. \nOf course. The idea was a straight swap. The girl \nagainst his cheque for forty million. Well, he wouldn't \nplay: wouldn't think of playing. She was in the Service \nand knew what she was up against. He wouldn't even \nask M. This job was more important than her. It was \njust too bad. She was a fine girl, but he wasn't going to \nfall for this childish trick. No dice. He would try and \ncatch the Citroen and shoot it out with them; and if she \ngot shot in the process that was too bad too. He would \nhave done his stuff — tried to rescue her before they got \nher off to some hide-out — but if he didn't catch up with \nthem he would get back to his hotel and go to sleep and \nsay no more about it. The next morning he would ask \nMathis what had happened to her and show him the \nnote. If Le Chiffre put the touch on Bond for the money \nin exchange for the girl, Bond would do nothing and tell \n\n\n\n100 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nno one. The girl would just have to take it. If the com- \nmissionaire came along with the story of what he had \nseen, Bond would bluff it out by saying he had had a \ndrunken row with the girl. \n\nBond's mind raged furiously on with the problem as \nhe flung the great car down the coast-road, \nautomatically taking the curves and watching out for \ncarts or cyclists on their way to Royale. On straight \nstretches the Amherst Villiers supercharger dug spurs \ninto the Bentley's twenty-five horses, and the engine \nsent a high-pitched scream of pain into the night. Then \nthe revolutions mounted until he was past 110 and on to \nthe 120 m. p. h. mark on the speedometer. \n\nHe knew he must be gaining fast. Loaded as she was, \nthe Citroen could hardly better eighty even on this road. \nOn an impulse he slowed down to seventy, turned on his \nfoglights, and dowsed the twin-Marchals. Sure enough, \nwithout the blinding curtain of his own lights, he could \nsee the glow of another car a mile or two down the \ncoast. \n\nHe felt under the dashboard and from a concealed \nholster took out a long- barrelled Colt Army Special .45 \nand laid it on the seat beside him. With this, if he was \nlucky with the surface of the road, he could hope to get \ntheir tyres or their petrol tank at anything up to a hun- \ndred yards. \n\nThen he switched on the big lights again and screamed \noff in pursuit. He felt calm and at ease. The problem of \nVesper's life was a problem no longer. His face in the \nblue light from the dashboard was grim but serene. \n\nAhead in the Citroen there were three men and the \ngirl. \n\nLe Chiffre was driving, his big fluid body hunched \nforward, his hands light and delicate on the wheel. \nBeside him sat the squat man who had carried the stick \nin the Casino. In his left hand he grasped a thick lever \nwhich protruded beside him almost level with the floor. \n\n\n\nBLACK HARE AND GREY HOUND \n\n\n\n101 \n\n\n\nIt might have been ; a lever to adjust the driving-seat. \n\nIn the back seat was the tall thin gunman. He lay back, \nrelaxed, gazing at the ceiling, apparently uninterested in \nthe wild speed of the car. His right hand lay caressingly \non Vesper's left thigh which stretched out naked beside \nhim. '■ \n\nApart from her legs, which were naked to the hips. \nVesper was only a parcel. Her long black velvet skirt \nhad been lifted over her arms and head and tied above \nher head with a piece of rope. Where her face was, a \nsmall gap had been torn in the velvet so that she could \nbreathe. She was not bound in any other way, and she \nlay quiet, her body moving sluggishly with the swaying \nof the car. \n\nLe Chiffre was concentrating half on the road ahead \nand half on the onrushing- glare of Bond's headlights in \nthe driving mirror. He seemed undisturbed when not \nmore than a mile separated the hare from the hounds,' \nand he even brought the car down from eighty to sixty \nmiles an hour. Now, as he swept round a bend he slowed \ndown still further. A few hundred yards ahead a \nMichelin post showed where a small parochial road \n, crossed with the highway. \n\n'Attention,' he said sharply to the man beside him. \n\nThe man's hand tightened on the lever. \n\nA hundred yards from the crossroads he slowed to \nthirty. In the mirror Bond's great headlights were \nlighting up the bend. j. \n\nLe Chiffre seemed to make up his mind. \n\n'Allez.' \n\nThe man beside him pulled the lever sharply upwards. \nThe boot at the back of the car yawned open like a \nwhale's mouth. There was a tinkling clatter on the road \nand then a rhythmic jangling as if the car was towing \nlengths of chain behind it. \n\n'Coupez.' \n\nThe man depressed the lever sharply and the jangling \nstopped with a final clatter. ( \n\n\n\n102 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nLe Chiffre glanced again in the mirror. Bond's car \nwas just entering the bend. Le Chiffre made a racing \nchange and threw the Citroen left-handed down the \nnarrow side-road, at the same time dowsing his lights. \n\nHe stopped the car with a jerk, and all three men got \nswiftly out and doubled back under cover of a low \nhedge to the crossroads, now fiercely illuminated by the \nlights of the Bentley. Each of them carried a revolver, \nand the thin man also had what looked like a large egg \nin his right hand. \n\nThe Bentley screamed down towards them like an ex- \npress train. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16 \n\nThe Crawling of the Skin \n\n\n\nAs Bond hurtled round the bend, caressing the \ngreat car against the camber with an easy sway of body \nand hands, he was working out his plan of action when \nthe distance between the two cars should narrow still \nfurther. He imagined that the enemy driver would try to \ndodge off into a side-road if he got the chance. So when \nhe had got found the bend and saw no lights ahead, it \nwas a normal reflex to ease up on the accelerator and, \nwhen he saw the Michelin post, to prepare to brake. \n\nHe was only doing about sixty as he approached the \nblack patch across the right-hand crown of the road \nwhich he assumed to be the shadow cast by a wayside \ntree. Even so, there was no time to save himself. There \nwas suddenly a small carpet of glinting steel spikes right \nunder his off-side wing. Then he was on top of it. \n\nBond automatically slammed the brakes full on and \nbraced all his sinews against the wheel to correct the \ninevitable sharp slew to the left, but he only kept control \nfor a split second. As the rubber was flayed from his \n\n\n\n103 \n\n\n\n104 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\noff-side wheels and the rims for an instant tore up the \ntarmac, the heavy car whirled across the road in a \ntearing dry skid, slammed the left bank with a crash that \nknocked Bond out of the driving seat on to the floor; \nand then, facing back up the road, it reared slowly \nup, its front wheels spinning and its great headlights \nsearching the sky. For a split second, resting on the \npetrol tank, it seemed to paw at the heavens like a giant \npraying-mantis. Then slowly it toppled over backwards \nand fell with a splintering crash of coachwork and glass. \n\nIn the deafening silence, the near-side front wheel \nwhispered briefly on and then squeaked to a stop. \n\nLe Chiffre and his two men only had to walk a few \nyards from their ambush. \n\n'Put your guns away and get him out,' he ordered \nbrusquely. 'I'll keep you covered. Be careful of him. I \ndon't want a corpse. And hurry up, it's getting light.' \n\nThe two men got down on their knees. One of them \ntook out a long knife and cut some of the fabric away \nfrom the side of the convertible hood and took hold of \nBond's shoulders. He was unconscious and immovable. \nThe other squeezed between the up-turned car and the \nbank and forced his way through the crumpled window- \nframe. He eased Bond's legs, pinned between the \nsteering wheel and the fabric roof of the car. Then they \ninched him out through a hole in the hood. \n\nThey were sweating and filthy with dust and oil by the \ntime they had him lying in the road. \n\nThe thin man felt his heart and then slapped his face \nhard on either side. Bond grunted and moved a hand. \nThe thin man slapped him again. \n\n'That's enough,' said Le Chiffre. 'Tie his arms, and \nput him in the car. Here.' He threw a roll of flex to the \nman. 'Empty his pockets first and give me his gun. He \nmay have got some other weapons, but we can get them \nlater.' \n\nHe took the objects the thin man handed him and \n\n\n\nTHE CRAWLING OFTHESKIN \n\n\n\n105 \n\n\n\nstuffed them and Bond's Beretta into his wide pockets \nwithout examining them. He left the men to it and \nwalked back to the car. His face showed neither \npleasure nor excitement. \n\nIt was the sharp bite of the wire flex into his wrists \nthat brought Bond to himself. He was aching all over as \nif he had been thrashed with a wooden club; but when \nhe was yanked to his feet and pushed towards the \nnarrow side-road where the engine of the Citrogn was \nalready running softly, he found that no bones were \nbroken. But he felt in no mood for desperate attempts \nto escape and allowed himself to be dragged into the \nback seat of the car without resisting. \n\nHe felt thoroughly dispirited and weak in resolve as \nwell as in his body. He had had to take too much in the \npast twenty-four hours and now this last stroke by the \nenemy seemed almost too final. This time there could be \nno miracles. No one knew where he was and no one \nwould miss him until well on into the morning. The \nwreck of his car would be found before very long, but it \nwould take hours to trace the ownership to him. \n\nAnd Vesper. He looked to the right, past the thin man \nwho was lying back with his eyes closed. His first reac- \ntion was one of scorn. Damn fool girl getting herself \ntrussed up like a chicken, having her skirt pulled over \nher head as if the whole of this business was some kind \nof dormitory rag. But then he felt sorry for her. Her \nnaked legs looked so childlike and defenceless. \n\n'Vesper,' he said softly. \n\nThere was no answer from the bundle in the corner, \nand Bond suddenly had a chill feeling; but then she \nstirred slightly. \n\nAt the same time the thin man caught him a hard \nback-handed blow over the heart . \n\n'Silence.' \n\nBond doubled over with pain and to shield himself \nfrom another blow, only to get a rabbit punch on the \n\n\n\n106 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nback of the neck which made him arch back again, the \nbreath whistling through his teeth. \n\nThe thin man had hit him a hard professional cutting \nblow with the edge of the hand. There was something \nrather deadly about his accuracy and his lack of effort. \nHe was now again lying back, his eyes closed. He was a \nman to make you afraid, an evil man. Bond hoped he \nmight get a chance of killing him. \n\nSuddenly the boot of the car was thrown open, and \nthere was a clanking crash. Bond guessed that they had \nbeert waiting for the third man to retrieve the carpet of \nspiked chain-mail. He assumed it must be an adapta- \ntion of the nail-studded devices used by the Resistance \nagainst German staff-cars. \n\nAgain he reflected on the efficiency of these people \nand the ingenuity of the equipment they used. Had M. \nunderestimated their resourcefulness? He stifled a \ndesire to place the blame on London. It was he who \nshould have known. He who should have been warned \nby small signs and taken infinitely more precautions. He \nsquirmed as he thought of himself washing down cham- \npagne in the Roi Galant while the enemy was busy \npreparing his counterstroke. He cursed himself and \ncursed the hubris which had made him so sure that the \nbattle was won and the enemy in flight. \n\nAll this time Le Chiffre had said nothing. Directly the \nboot was shut, the third man, whom Bond at once \nrecognized, climbed in beside him, and Le Chiffre re- \nversed furiously back on the main road. Then he banged \nthe gear lever through the gate and was soon doing \nseventy on down the coast. \n\nBy now it was dawn — about five o'clock, Bond \nguessed — and he reflected that a mile or two on was the \nturning to Le Chiffre's villa. He had not thought that \nthey would take Vesper there. Now that he realized that \nVesper had only been a sprat to catch a mackerel the \nwhole picture became clear. \n\nIt was an extremely unpleasant picture. For the first \n\n\n\nTHE CRAWLING OFTHE SKIN \n\n\n\n107 \n\n\n\ntime since his capture, fear came to Bond and crawled \nup his spine. \n\nTen minutes later the Citroen lurched to the left, ran \non a few hundred yards up a small side road partly \novergrown with grass and then between a pair of \ndilapidated stucco pillars into an unkempt forecourt \nsurrounded by a high wall. They drew up in front of a \npeeling white door. Above a rusty bell-push in the door- \nframe, small zinc letters on a wooden base spelled out \n'Les Noctambules' and, underneath 'SonnezSVP.' \n\nFrom what Bond could see of the cement frontage, \nthe villa was typical of the French seaside style. He \ncould imagine the dead bluebottles being hastily swept \nout for the summer let and the stale rooms briefly aired \nby a cleaning woman sent by the estate agent in Royale. \nEvery five years one coat of whitewash would be \nslapped over the rooms and the outside woodwork, and \nfor a few weeks the villa would present a smiling front \nto the world. Then the winter rains would get to work, \nand the imprisoned flies, and quickly the villa would \ntake on again its abandoned look. \n\nBut, Bond reflected, it would admirably serve Le \nChiffre's purpose this morning, if he was right in \nassuming what that was to be. They had passed no other \nhouse since his capture, and from his reconnaissance of \nthe day before he knew there was only an occasional \nfarm for several miles to the south. \n\nAs he was urged out of the car with a sharp crack in \nthe ribs , from the thin man's elbow, he knew that Le \nChiffre could have them both to himself, undisturbed, \nfor several hours. Again his skin crawled. \n\nLe Chiffre opened the door with a key and disap- \npeared inside. Vesper, looking incredibly indecent in the \nearly light of day, was pushed in after him with a torrent \nof lewd French from the man whom Bond knew to him- \nself as 'the Corsican.' Bond followed without giving the \nthin man a chance to urge him. \n\nThe key of the front door turned in the lock. \n\n\n\n108 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nLe Chiffre was standing in the doorway of a room on \nthe right. He crooked a finger at Bond in a silent, \nspidery summons. \n\nVesper was being led down a passage towards the \nback of the house. Bond suddenly decided. \n\nWith a wild backward kick which connected with the \nthin man's shins and brought a whistle of pain from \nhim, he hurled himself down the passage after her. With \nonly his feet as weapons, there was no plan in his mind \nexcept to do as much damage as possible to the two gun- \nmen and be able to exchange a few hurried words with \nthe girl. No other plan was possible. He just wanted to \ntell her not to give in. \n\nAs the Corsican turned at the commotion Bond was \non him and his right shoe was launched in a flying kick \nat the other man's groin. \n\nLike lightning the Corsican slammed himself back \nagainst the wall of the passage and, as Bond's foot \nwhistled past his hip, he very quickly, but somehow \ndelicately, shot out his left hand, caught Bond's shoe at \nthe top of its arc and twisted it sharply. \n\nCompletely off balance, Bond's other foot left the \nground. In the air his whole body turned and with the \nmomentum of his rush behind it crashed sideways and \ndown on to the floor. \n\nFor a moment he lay there, all the breath knocked out \nof him. Then the thin man came and hauled him up \nagainst the wall by his collar. He had a gun in his hand. \nHe looked Bond inquisitively in the eyes, Then \nunhurriedly he bent down and swiped the barrel \nviciously across Bond's shins. Bond grunted and caved \nat the knees. \n\n'If there is a next time, it will be across your teeth,' \nsaid the thin man in bad French. \n\nA door slammed. Vesper and the Corsican had disap- \npeared. Bond turned his head to the right. Le Chiffre \nhad moved a few feet out into the passage. He lifted his \n\n\n\nTHE CRAWLING OFTHESKIN \n\n\n\n109 \n\n\n\nfinger and crooked it again. Then for the first time he \nspoke. \n\n'Come, my dear friend. We are wasting our time.' \n\nHe spoke in English with no accent. His voice was low \nand soft and unhurried. He showed no emotion. He \nmight have been a doctor summoning the next patient \nfrom the waiting-room, a hysterical patient who had \nbeen expostulating feebly with a nurse. \n\nBond again felt puny and impotent. Nobody but an \nexpert in ju-jitsu could have handled him with the Cor- \nsican's economy and lack of fuss. The cold precision \nwith which the thin man had paid him back in his own \ncoin had been equally unhurried, even artistic. \n\nAlmost docilely Bond walked back down the passage. \nHe had nothing but a few more bruises to show for his \nclumsy gesture o f resistance to these people . \n\nAs he preceded the thin man over the threshold he \nknew that he was utterly and absolutely in their power, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17 \n\n'My Dear Boy' \n\n\n\ni ,. . \n\nIt was a large bare room, sparsely furnished in \ncheap French 'art nouveau' style. It was difficult to say \nwhether it was intended as a living- or dining-room, for \na flimsy-looking mirrored sideboard, sporting an \norange crackle-ware fruit dish and two painted wooden \ncandlesticks, took up most of the wall opposite the door \nand contradicted the faded pink sofa ranged against the \nother side of the room. \n\nThere was no table in the centre under the \nalabasterine ceiling light, only a small square of stained \ncarpet with a futurist design in contrasting browns. \n\nOver by the window was an incongruous-looking \nthrone-like chair in carved oak with a red velvet seat, a \nlow table on which stood an empty water carafe and two \nglasses, and a light armchair with a round cane seat and \nno cushion. \n\nHalf-closed Venetian blinds obscured the view from \nthe window, but cast bars of early sunlight over the few \npieces of furniture and over part of the brightly papered \n\n\n\n110 \n\n\n\nMY DEAR BOY' \n\n\n\n111 \n\n\n\nwall and the brown-stained floorboards. \n\nLe Chif fre pointed at the cane chair. \n\n'That will do excellently,' he said to the thin man. \n'Prepare him quickly. If he resists, damage him only a \nlittle.' \n\nHe turned to Bond. There was no expression on his \nlarge face, and his round eyes were uninterested. 'Take \noff your clothes. For every effort to resist, Basil will \nbreak one of your fingers. We are serious people, and \nyour good health is of no interest to us. Whether you \nlive or die depends on the outcome of the talk we are \nabout to have.' \n\nHe made a gesture toward the thin man and left the \nroom. \n\nThe thiri man's first action was a curious one. He \nopened the clasp-knife he had used on the hood of \nBond's car, took the small armchair, and with a swift \nmotion cut out its cane seat. \n\nThen he came back to Bond, sticking the still open \nknife, like a fountain pen, in the vest pocket of his coat. \nHe turned Bond round to the light and unwound the \nflex from his wrists. Then he stood quickly aside, and \nthe knife was back in his right hand. \n\n'Vite.' \n\nBond stood chafing his swollen wrists and debating \nwith himself how much time he could waste by resisting. \nHe only delayed an instant. With a swift step and a \ndownward sweep of his free hand, the thin man seized \nthe collar of his dinner jacket and dragged it down, \npinning Bond's arms back. Bond made the traditional \ncounter to this old policeman's hold by dropping down \non one knee; but as he dropped the thin man dropped \nwith him and at the same time brought his knife round \nand down behind Bond's back. Bond felt the back of \nthe blade pass down his spine. There was the hiss of a \nsharp knife through cloth and his arms were suddenly \nfree as the two halves of his coat fell forward. \n\nHe cursed and stood up. The thin man was back in his . \n\n\n\n112 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nprevious position, his knife again at the ready in his \nrelaxed hand. Bond let the two halves of his dinner \njacket fall off his arms on to the floor. \n\n'Allez,' said the thin man with a faint trace of im- \npatience. \n\nBond looked him in the eye and then slowly started to \ntake off his shirt. \n\nLe Chiffre came quietly back into the room. He \ncarried a pot of what smelt like coffee. He put it on the \nsmall table near the window. He also placed beside it on \nthe table two other homely objects, a three-foot-long \ncarpet-beater in twisted cane and a carving-knife. \n\nHe settled himself comfortably on the thronelike \nchair and poured some of the coffee into one of the \nglasses. With one foot he hooked forward the small \narmchair, whose seat was now an empty circular frame \nof wood, until it was directly opposite him. \n\nBond stood stark naked in the middle , of the room, \nbruises showing livid on his white body, his face a grey \nmask of exhaustion and knowledge of what was to \ncome. \n\n'Sit down there.' Le Chiffre nodded at the chair in \nfront of him. \n\nBond walked over and sat down. \n\nThe thin man produced some flex. With this he bound \nBond's wrists to the arms of the chair and his ankles to \nthe front legs. He passed a double strand across his \nchest, under the arrnpits and through the chair-back. He \nmade no mistakes with the knots and left no play in any \nof the bindings. All of them bit sharply into Bond's \nflesh. The legs of the chair were broadly spaced and \nBond could not even rock it. \n\nHe was utterly a prisoner, naked and defenceless. \n\nHis buttocks and the underpart of his body protruded \nthrough the seat of the chair towards the floor. \n\nLe Chiffre nodded to the thin man, who quietly left \nthe room and closed the door. \n\nThere was a packet of Gauloises on the table and a \n\n\n\n'MY DEAR BOY\" \n\n\n\nlighter. Le Chiffre lit a cigarette and\\ \nmouthful of coffee from the glass. Then \\ \nthe cahe carpet-beater and, resting the h \nfortably on his knee, allowed the flat trefoilX ^ ne \non the floor directly under Bond's chair. \\ ^ \n\nHe looked Bond carefully, almost caressingly in the \neyes. Then his wrist sprang suddenly upwards on his \nknee. \n\nThe result was startling. \n\nBond's whole body arched in an involuntary spasm. \nHis face contracted in a soundless scream, and his lips \ndrew right away from his teeth. At the same time his \nhead flew back with a jerk showing the taut sinews of \nhis neck. For an instant, muscles stood out in knots all \nover his body, and his toes and fingers clenched until \nthey were quite white. Then his body sagged, and per- \nspiration started to bead all over his skin. He uttered a \ndeep groan. — \n\nLe Chiffre Waited for his eyes to open. \n\n'You see, dear boy?' He smiled a soft, fat smile. 'Is \nthe position quite clear now? ' \n\nA drop of sweat fell off Bond's chin on to his naked \nchest. ■ \n\n'Now let us get down to business and see how soon we \ncan be finished with this unfortunate mess you have got \nyourself into.' He puffed cheerfully at his cigarette and \ngave an admonitory tap on the floor beneath Bond's \nchair with his horrible and incongruous instrument. \n\n'My dear boy' — Le Chiffre spoke like a father — 'the \ngame of Red Indians is over, quite over. You have \nstumbled by mischance into a game for grown-ups, and \nyou have already found it a painful experience. You are \nnot equipped, my dear boy, to play games with adults; \nand it was very foolish of your nanny in London to have \nsent you out here with your spade and bucket. Very \nfoolish indeed, and most unfortunate for you. \n\n'But we must stop joking, my dear fellow, although I \nam sure you would like to follow me in developing this \n\n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n- . \n\njPJ^autionary tale, \n'emy dropped his bantering tone and looked \nat Bond sharply and venomously. \n1 Where is the money? ' \n\nBond's bloodshot eyes looked emptily back at him. \n\nAgain the upward jerk of the wrist, and again Bond's \nwhole body writhed and contorted. \n\nLe Chiffre waited until the tortured heart eased down \nits laboured pumping and until Bond's eyes dully \nopened again. \n\n'Perhaps I should explain,' said Le Chiffre. 'I intend \nto continue attacking the sensitive parts of your body \nuntil you answer my question. I am without mercy, and \nthere will be no relenting. There is no one to stage a last- \nminute rescue, and there is no possibility of escape for \nyou. This is not a romantic adventure story in which the \nvillain is finally routed and the hero is given a medal and \nmarries the girl. Unfortunately these things don't \nhappen in real life. If you continue to be obstinate, you \nwill be tortured to the edge of madness, and then the girl \nwill be brought in and we will set about her in front of \nyou. If that is still not enough, you will both b \n--689108c3aba5449d9702405fe712d158-- \n","docTitle":"","docDate":"2016-03-18
