Both her doors were locked, and when he \nmade her let him in he saw that she had been sitting in \nthe shadows by the window— watching, he presumed. \n\nHer face was of cold stone. He led her to the bed and \ndrew her down beside him. They sat stiffly, like people \nin a railway carriage. ' \n\n'Vesper,' he said, holding her cold hands in his, 'we \ncan't go on like this. We must finish with it. We are tor- \nturing each other, and there is only one way of stopping \nit. Either you must tell me what all this is about or we \nmust leave. At once.' \n\nShe said nothing, and her hands were lifeless in his. \n\n'My darling,' he said. 'Won't you tell me? Do you \nknow, that first morning I was coming back to ask you \nto marry me. Can't we go back to the beginning again? \nWhat is this dreadful nightmare that is killing us? ' \n\nAt first she said nothing, then a tear rolled slowly \ndown her cheek. \n\n'You mean you would have married me?' \n\nBond nodded. \n\n\n\n172 CASINO ROYALE \\ \n\n'Oh, my God!' she cried. 'My God!' She turned and \nclutched him, pressing her face against his chest. \n\nHe held her closely to him. 'Tell me, my love,' he j \nsaid. 'Tell me what's hurting you.' \n\nHer sobs became quieter. '•■ \n\n'Leave me for a little,' she said. A new note had come \n' into her voice: a note of resignation. 'Let me think for a \nlittle.' She kissed his face and held it between her hands. \nShe looked at him with yearning. 'Darling, I'm trying to \ndo what's best for us. Please believe me. But it's \nterrible. I'm in a frightful . . .' She wept again, clutching \nhim like a child with nightmares. \n\nHe soothed her, stroking the long black hair and \nkissing her softly. \n\n'Go away now,' she said. 'I must have time to think. \nWe've got to do something.' \n\nShe took his handkerchief and dried her eyes. \n\nShe led him to the door, and there they held tightly to \neach other. Then he kissed her again, and she shut the \ndoor behind him. \n\nThat evening most of the gayness and intimacy of \ntheir first night came back. She was excited, and some \nof her laughter sounded brittle;, but Bond was deter- \nmined to fall in with her new mood, and it was only at \nthe end of dinner that he had made a passing remark \nwhich made her pause. \n\nShe put her hand over his. \n\n'Don't talk about it now,' she said. 'Forget it now. \nIt's all past. I'll tell you about it in the morning.' \n\nShe looked at him, and suddenly her eyes were full of \ntears. She found a handkerchief in her bag and dabbed \nat them. \n\n'Give me some more champagne,' she said. She gave \na queer little laugh. 'I want a lot more. You drink much \nmore than me. It's not fair.' \n\nThey sat and drank together until the bottle was \nfinished. Then she got to her feet. She knocked against \nher chair and giggled. \n\n\n\n'SLEEP WELL, MY DARLING* \n\n\n\n173 \n\n\n\n'I do believe I'm tight,' she said. 'How disgraceful! \nPlease, James, don't be ashamed of me. I do so want to \nbe gay. And I am gay.' \n\nShe stood behind him and ran her fingers through his \nblack hair. \n\n'Come up quickly, ' she said. \n\nShe blew a kiss at him and was gone. \n\nFor two hours they made slow, sweet love in a mood \nof happy passion which, the day before, Bond would \nnever have thought they could regain. The barriers of \nself-consciousness and mistrust seemed to have \nvanished; the words they spoke to each other were in- \nnocent and true again, and there was no shadow be- \ntween them. \n\n'You must go now,' said Vesper when Bond had slept \nfor a while in her arms. \n\nAs if to take back her words she held him more \nclosely to her, murmuring endearments and pressing her \nbody down the whole length of his. \n\nWhen he finally rose and bent to smooth back her \nhair and finally kiss her eyes and her mouth good night, \nshe reached out and turned on the light. \n\n'Look at me,' she said, 'and let me look at you.' \n\nHe knelt beside her. \n\nShe examined every line of his face as if she were \nseeing him for the first time. Then she reached up and \nput an arm round his neck. Her deep blue -eyes were \nswimming with tears as she drew his head slowly to- \nwards her and kissed him gently on the lips. Then she let \nhim go and turned off the light. \n\n'Good night, my dearest love, ' she said. \n\nBond bent and kissed her. He tasted the tears on her \ncheek. . \n\nHe Went to the door and looked back. \n\n'Sleep well, my darling,' he said. 'Don't worry, \neverything's all right now. ' \n\nHe closed the door softly and walked to his room with ' \na full heart. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER 27 \n\nThe Bleeding Heart \n\n\n\nThe patron brought him the letter in the \nmorning. \n\nHe burst into Bond's room, holding the envelope in \nfront of him as if it were on fire. \n\n'There has been a terrible accident. Madame — ' \n\nBond hurled himself out of bed and through the \nbathroom, but the communicating door was locked. He \ndashed back and through his room and down the \ncorridor past a shrinking, terrified maid. \n\nVesper's door was open. The sunlight through the \nshutters lit up the room. Only her black hair showed \naboye the sheet, and her body under the bedclothes was \nstraight and moulded like a stone effigy on a tomb. \n\nBond fell on his knees beside her and drew back the \nsheet. \n\nShe was asleep. She must be. Her 'eyes were closed. \nThere was no change in the dear face. She was just as \nshe would look, and yet, and yet she was so still — no \n\n\n\n174 \n\n\n\nTHE BLEEDING HEART \n\n\n\n175 \n\n\n\nmovement, no pulse, no breath. That was it. There was \nno breath. \n\nLater the patron came and touched him on the \nshoulder. He pointed at the empty glass on the table \nbeside her. There were white dregs in the bottom of it. It \nstood beside her book and her cigarettes and matches \nand the small pathetic litter of her mirror and lipstick \nand handkerchief. And on the floor the empty bottle of \nsleeping-pills, the pills Bond had seen in the bathroom \nthat first evening. \n\nBond rose to his feet and shook himself. The patron \nwas still holding out the letter towards him. He took it. \n\n'Please notify the Commissaire,' said Bond. 'I will be \nin my roW when he wants me. ' \n\nHe walked blindly away without a backward glance. \n\nHe sat on the edge of his bed and gazed out of the \nwindow at the peaceful sea. Then he stared dully at the \n. envelope. It was addressed simply in a large round \nhand, 'Pour Lui.' \n\nThe thought passed through Bond's mind that she \nmust have left orders to be called early, so that he would \nnot be the one to find her. , \n\nHe turned the envelope over. Not long ago her warm \ntongue had sealed the flap. \n\nHe gave a sudden shrug and opened it. \n\nIt was not long. After the first few words he read it \nquickly, the breath coming harshly through his nostrils. \n\nThen he threw it down on the bed as if it had been a \nscorpion. \n\nMy darling James [the letter opened], \n\nI love you with all my heart, and while you read \nthese words I hope you still love me because, now, \n. with these words, this is the last moment that your \nlove will last. So goodbye, my sweet love, while we \nstill love each other. Goodbye, my darling. \nI am an agent of the M. W.D. Yes, I am a \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\ndouble agent for the Russians. I was taken on a \nyear after the war, and I have worked for them \never since. I was in love with a Pole in the R.A.F. \nUntil you, I still was. You can find out who he \nwas. He had two D.S.O.'s, and after the war he \nwas trained by M. and dropped back into Poland. \nThey caught him, and by torturing him they found \nout a lot and also about me. They came after me \nand told me he could live if I would work for \nthem. He knew nothing of this, but he was \nallowed 'to write to me. The letter arrived on the \nfifteenth of each month. I found I couldn't stop. I \ncouldn't bear the idea of a fifteenth coming round \nwithout his letter. It would mean that I had killed \nhim. I tried to give them as little as possible. You \nmust believe me about this. Then it came to you. I \ntold, them you had been given this job. at Royale, \nwhat your cover was, and so on. That is why they \nknew about you before you arrived, and why they \nhad time to put the microphones in. They sus- \npected Le Chiffre, but they didn't know what your \nassignment was except that it was something to do \nwith him. That was all I told them. \n\nThen I was told not to stand behind you in the \nCasino, and to see that neither Mathis nor Leiter \ndid. That was why the gunman was nearly able to \nshoot you. Then I had to stage that kidnapping. \nYou may have wondered why I was so quiet in the \nnight club. They didn't hurt me because I was \nworking for M.W.D. \n\nBut. when I found out what had been done to \nyou, even though it was Le Chiffre who did it and \nhe turned out to be a traitor, I decided I couldn't \ngo on. By that time I had begun to fall in love with \nyou. They wanted me to find out things from you \nwhile you were recovering, but I refused. I was \ncontrolled from Paris. I had to ring up an In- \nvalides number twice a day. They threatened me; \n\n\n\nTHE BLEEDING HEART \n\n\n\n177 \n\n\n\nand finally they withdrew my control, and I knew \nmy lover in Poland would have to die. But they \nwere afraid I would talk, I suppose, and I got a \nfinal warning that SMERSH would come for me if I \ndidn't obey them. I took no notice, I was in love \nwith you. Then I saw the man with the black patch \nin the Splendide, and I found he had been making \ninquiries about my movements. This was the day \nbefore we came down here. I hoped I could shake \nhim off. I decided that we would have an affair \nand I Would escape to South America from Le \nHavre. I hoped I would have a baby of yours and \nbe able to start again somewhere. But they \nfollowed us. You can't get away from them. \n\nI knew it would be the end of our love if I told \nyou. I realized that I could either wait to be killed \nby Smersh and perhaps get you killed too, or I \ncould kill myself. \n\nThere it is, my darling love. You can't stop me \ncalling you that or saying that I love you. I am \ntaking that with me, and the memories of you. \n\nI can't tell yoU much to help you. The Paris \nnumber was Invalides 55200. I never met any of \nthem in London. Everything was done through an \naccommodation address, a news-agent's at 450 \nCharing Cross Place. \n\nAt our first dinner together you talked about \nthat man in Yugoslavia who was found guilty of \ntreason. He said: 'I was carried away by the gale \nof the world.' That's my only excuse. That, and \nfor love of the man whose life I tried to save. \n\nIt's late now and I'm tired, and you're just \nthrough two doors. But I've got to be brave. You \nmight save my life, but I couldn't bear the look in \nyour dear eyes. \n\nMy love, my love. \n\nV. \n\n\n\n178 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nBond threw the letter down. Mechanically he brushed \nhis fingers together. Suddenly he banged his temples \nwith his fists and stood up. For a moment he looked out \ntowards the quiet sea, then he cursed aloud, One harsh \nobscenity. \n\nHis eyes were wet, and he dried them. \n\nHe pulled on a shirt and trousers, and with a set cold \nface he walked down and shut himself in the telephone- \nbooth. \n\nWhile he was getting through to London, he calmly \nreviewed the facts of Vesper's letter. They all fitted. The \nlittle shadows and question marks of the past four \nweeks, which his instinct had noted but his mind re- \njected, all stood out now like signposts. \n\nHe saw her now only as a spy. Their love and his grief \nwere relegated to the boxroom of his mind. Later, \nperhaps they would be dragged out, dispassionately \nexamined, and then bitterly thrust back with other sen- \ntimental baggage he would rather forget. Now he could \nonly think of her treachery to the Service and to her \ncountry, and of the damage it had done. His \nprofessional mind was completely absorbed with the \nconsequences — the covers which must have been blown \nover the years, the codes which the enemy must have \nbroken, the secrets which must have leaked from the \ncentre of the very section devoted to penetrating the \nSoviet Union. \n\nIt was ghastly. God knew how the mess would be \ncleared up. \n\nHe ground his teeth. Suddenly Mathis's words came \nback to him: 'There are plenty of really black targets \naround,' and, earlier, 'What about SMERSH? I don't like \nthe idea of these chaps running around France killing \nanyone they feel has been a traitor to their precious \npolitical system.' \n\nBond grinned bitterly to himself. \n\nHow soon Mathis had been proved right, and how \n\n\n\nY\/'.'--;- '- : ' >i --\" ••' ' THE BLEEDING HEART\" . 179 - \n\nsoon his own little sophistries had been exploded in his \nface! \n\nWhile he, Bond, had been playing Red Indians \nthrough the years (yes, Le Chiffre's description was per- \nfectly accurate), the real enemy had been working \nquietly, coldly, without heroics, right there at his elbow. \n\nHe suddenly had a vision of Vesper walking down a \ncorridor with documents in her hand. On a tray. They \njust got it on a tray while the cool secret agent with a \nDouble O number was gallivanting round the \nworld— playing Red Indians. \n\nHis fingernails dug into the palms of his hands, and \nhis body sweated with shame. \n\nWell, it was not too late. Here was a target for him, \nright to hand. He would take on SMERSH and hunt it \ndown* Without smersh, without this cold weapon of \ndeath and revenge, the M.W.D. would be just another \nbunch of civil servant spies, no better and no worse than \nany of the western services. • . ■ , \n\nSMERSH was the spur. Be faithful, spy well, or you \ndie. Inevitably and without any question, you will be \nhunted down and killed. \n\nIt was the same with the whole Russian machine. Fear \nwas the impulse. For them it was always safer to ad-' \nVance than to retreat. Advance against the enemy, and \nthe bullet might miss you. Retreat, evade, betray, and \nthe bullet would never miss.- \n\nBut now he would attack the arm that held the whip \nand the gun. The business of espionage could be left to \nthe white-collar boys. They could spy and catch the \nspies. He would go after the threat behind the spies, the \nthreat that made them spy. \n\nThe telephone rang, and Bond snatched up the \nreceiver. \n\nHe was on to 'the Link,' the outside liaison officer \nwho was the only man in London he might telephone \nfrom abroad. Then only in dire necessity. \n\n\n\n180 \n\n\n\nCASINO ROYALE \n\n\n\nHe spoke quietly into the receiver. \n\n'This is 007 speaking. This is- an open. line. It's an \nemergency. Can you hear me? . . . Pass this on at once: \n3030 was a double, working for Redland. . . . \n\n'Yes, dammit, I said \"was. \" The bitch is dead now.
